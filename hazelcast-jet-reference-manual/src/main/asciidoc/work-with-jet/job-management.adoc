= Jet Command Line Tool

Jet comes with a command line tool, `jet`, which you can use to submit
jobs and do basic management of their lifecycle. It supports these
commands:

[%header]
|===
|Command|Description
|`submit`|Submits a job to the cluster
|`cancel`|Cancels a running job
|`list-jobs`|Lists running jobs on the cluster
|`cluster`|Shows current cluster state and information about members
|`suspend`|Suspends a running job
|`resume`|Resumes a suspended job
|`restart`|Restarts a running job
|`list-snapshots`|Lists saved snapshots on the cluster
|`save-snapshot`|Saves a named snapshot from a job (Jet Enterprise only)
|`delete-snapshot`|Deletes a named snapshot
|===

The `jet` command uses a Jet Client under the hood and thus needs to
proper configuration to be able to connect to your cluster. By default
it uses the settings from `config/hazelcast-client.yaml` in the
distribution package, which has presets that will connect to Jet instance
on the local machine. You can customize it by editing the YAML
configuration, or by giving the connection parameters directly on the
command line. For example, you can pass the addresses of the cluster
members:

[source]
----
$ bin/jet -a 192.168.0.1:5701,192.168.0.1:5702 -c my-cluster list-jobs
----

This will try to connect to either `192.168.0.1:5701` or
`192.168.0.2:5702` using the cluster name `my-cluster` and list
all the running jobs in that cluster. If you want to use the tool
with a different config file, you can do it as follows:

[source]
----
$ bin/jet -f my-config.yaml list-jobs
----

You can pass job specific parameters when using `submit` option. These
parameters will be passed to your `main()` method, you can use them to
configure your pipeline. For example you can pass connection parameters
(ip port) for your source/sink:

....
bin/jet submit jetjob.jar 127.0.0.1 5555
....

For more details on its usage type `jet --help`.

[[management-center]]
= Management Center

Hazelcast Jet Management Center is a management and monitoring suite providing
a live overview of the Hazelcast Jet cluster.
Management Center includes a tool for diagnosing data flow within the
running Hazelcast Jet job. It provides a visualization of the computational
stages and allows you to peek into the stats across the data flow graph
enabling you to diagnose bottlenecks.

Please refer to the {jet-mc-refman}[Hazelcast Jet Management Center Reference Manual]
for installation and usage instructions.
