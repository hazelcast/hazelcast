= Jet Concepts

In this chapter we will take a deep dive into the fundamentals of
distributed computing and Jet's specific take on it. You'll find that
having some intuition and insight into how distributed computing
actually works in Jet makes a big difference when diagnosing your
pipeline and improving its performance.

Jet performs high performance in-memory data processing by modeling the
computation as a _Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)_, where vertices
represent computation and edges represent data flows. A vertex receives
data from its inbound edges, performs a step in the computation, and
emits data to its outbound edges. Both the edge and the vertex are
distributed entities: there are many parallel instances of the
`Processor` type that perform a single vertex's computation work on
each cluster member. An edge between two vertices is implemented with
many data connections, both within a member (concurrent SPSC queues) and
between members (Hazelcast network connections).

One of the major reasons to divide the full computation task into
several vertices is _data partitioning_: the ability to split the data
stream into slices which can be processed in parallel, independently of
each other. This is how Jet can parallelize and distribute the
_group-and-aggregate_ stream transformation, the major workhorse in
distributed computing. To make this work, there must be a function which
computes the _partitioning key_ for each item and makes all related
items map to the same key. Jet can then route all such items to the same
processor instance, but has the freedom to route items with different
keys to different processors.

Typically your computation job consists of a _mapping_ vertex, where you
pre-process the input data into a form that's ready to be partitioned,
followed by the grouping-and-aggregating vertex. The edge between them
contains the partitioning logic.

[[word-count-dag-model]]
== Modeling the Computation as a DAG

We'll take one specific problem, the Word Count, dissect it and explain
how it gets computed in a Jet cluster. Let us first see the definition
of the computation in the Pipeline API:

[source]
----
include::{javasource}/WhatIsDistributedComputing.java[tag=s1]
----

Now let's step back from this and start from the single-threaded Java
code that solves the problem for a basic data structure such as an
`ArrayList`. If you have some familiarity with the `java.util.stream`
API, this is how you'd express it:

[source]
----
include::{javasource}/WhatIsDistributedComputing.java[tag=s2]
----

You can notice a strong similarity with the Pipeline API formulation,
but the way it's executed is radically different. Java will compute it
in a single thread, basically running this code:

[source]
----
include::{javasource}/WhatIsDistributedComputing.java[tag=s3]
----

The j.u.s. formulation helps us see the steps taken to process each data
item:

1. `lines.stream()`: read the items (lines of text) from the data source
(we'll call this the "`source`" step).
2. `flatMap()`+`filter()`: split each line into lowercase words,
avoiding empty strings (the tokenizing step).
3. `collect()`: group equal words together and count them (the
accumulating step).

Our next move is to express these steps as a DAG. We'll start with a
single-threaded model and then make several transformations to reach a
parallelized, distributed one, discussing at each step the concerns that
arise and how to meet them.

We can represent the steps outlined above in a directed acyclic graph
(DAG):

image::wordcount-dag.png[Word-counting DAG,600,170,align="center"]

The simplest, single-threaded code (shown above) deals with each item as
it is produced: the outer loop reads the lines, the inner loop that runs
for each line deals with the words on that line, and inside the inner
loop we populate the result map with running counts.

However, just by modeling the computation as a DAG, we've split the work
into isolated steps with clear data interfaces between them. We can
perform the same computation by running a separate thread for each step.
Roughly speaking, these are the snippets the threads would be executing:

[source]
include::{javasource}/WhatIsDistributedComputing.java[tag=s4]

[source]
include::{javasource}/WhatIsDistributedComputing.java[tag=s5]

[source]
include::{javasource}/WhatIsDistributedComputing.java[tag=s6]

The source loop feeds the tokenizer loop over a concurrent queue, the
tokenizer feeds the accumulator loop, and after the accumulator is done
receiving, it emits its results to the sink. Diagrammatically it looks
like this:

image::wordcount-dag-queue.png[Word-counting DAG with concurrent queues shown,600,170,align="center"]

This transformation brought us a _pipelined_ architecture: while the
tokenizer is busy with the regex work, the accumulator is updating the
map using the data the tokenizer is done with; and the source and sink
stages are pumping the data from/to the environment. Our design is now
able to engage more than one CPU core and will complete that much
sooner; however, we're still limited by the number of vertices. We'll be
able utilize two or three cores regardless of how many are available. To
move forward we must try to parallelize the work of each individual
vertex.

Given that our input is an in-memory list of lines, the bottleneck
occurs in the processing stages (tokenizing and accumulating). Let's
first attack the tokenizing stage: it is a so-called "embarrassingly
parallelizable" task because the processing of each line is completely
self-contained. At this point we have to make a clear distinction
between the notions of _vertex_ and _processor_: there can be several
processors doing the work of a single vertex. Let's add another
tokenizing processor:

image::wordcount-tokenizer.png[Word-counting DAG with tokenizer vertex parallelized,600,170,align="center"]

The input processor can now use all the available tokenizers as a pool
and submit to any one whose queue has some room.

The next step is parallelizing the accumulator vertex, but this is
trickier: accumulators count word occurrences so using them as a pool
will result in each processor observing almost all distinct words
(entries taking space in its hashtable), but the counts will be partial
and will need combining. The common strategy to reduce memory usage is
to ensure that all occurrences of the same word go to the same
processor. This is called "`data partitioning`" and in Jet we'll use a
_partitioned edge_ between the tokenizer and the accumulator:

image::wordcount-partitioned.png[Word-counting DAG with tokenizer and accumulator parallelized,600,170,align="center"]

As a word is emitted from the tokenizer, it goes through a "`switchboard`"
stage where it's routed to the correct downstream processor. To
determine where a word should be routed, we can calculate its hashcode
and use the lowest bit to address either accumulator 0 or accumulator 1.

At this point we have a blueprint for a fully functional parallelized
computation job which can max out all the CPU cores given enough
instances of tokenizing and accumulating processors. The next challenge
is making this work across machines.

For starters, our input can no longer be a simple in-memory list because
that would mean each machine processes the same data. To exploit the
cluster as a unified computation device, each cluster member must
observe only a slice of the dataset. Given that a Jet instance is also a
fully functional Hazelcast IMDG instance and a Jet cluster is also a
Hazelcast IMDG cluster, the natural choice is to pre-load our data into
an `IMap`, which will be automatically partitioned and distributed
across the members. Now each Jet member can just read the slice of data
that was stored locally on it.

When run in a cluster, Jet will instantiate a replica of the whole DAG
on each member. On a two-member cluster there will be two source
processors, four tokenizers, and so on. The trickiest part is the
partitioned edge between tokenizer and accumulator: each accumulator is
supposed to receive its own subset of words. That means that, for
example, a word emitted from tokenizer 0 will have to travel across the
network to reach accumulator 3, if that's the one that happens to own
it. On average we can expect every other word to need network transport,
causing both serious network traffic and serialization/deserialization
CPU load.

There is a simple trick we can employ to avoid most of this traffic,
closely related to what we pointed above as a source of problems when
parallelizing locally: members of the cluster can be used as a pool,
each doing its own partial word counts, and then send their results to a
combining vertex. Note that this means sending only one item per
distinct word. Here's the rough equivalent of the code the combining
vertex executes:

[source]
include::{javasource}/WhatIsDistributedComputing.java[tag=s7]

As noted above, such a scheme takes more memory due to more hashtable
entries on each member, but it saves network traffic (an issue we didn't
have within a member). Given that memory costs scale with the number of
distinct keys (english words in our case), the memory cost is
more-or-less constant regardless of how much book material we process.
On the other hand, network traffic scales with the total data size so
the more material we process, the more we save on network traffic.

Jet distinguishes between _local_ and _distributed_ edges, so we'll use
a _local partitioned_ edge for `tokenize`->`accumulate` and a
_distributed partitioned_ edge for `accumulate`->`combine`. With this
move we've finalized our DAG design, which can be illustrated by the
following diagram:

image::wordcount-distributed.png[Word-counting DAG parallelized and distributed,600,170,align="center"]

[[unbounded-stream-processing]]
== Unbounded Stream Processing

So far we've worked with a bounded (finite) stream processing task.
In general, you provide Jet with one or more pre-existing datasets and
order it to mine them for interesting information. The most important
workhorse in this area is the "join, group and aggregate" operation: you
define a classifying function that computes a grouping key for each of
the datasets and an aggregate operation that will be performed on all
the items in each group, yielding one result item per distinct key. Jet
can apply the same operation on unbounded data streams as well.

=== The Importance of "`Right Now`"

In batch jobs the data we process represents a point-in-time snapshot of
our state of knowledge (for example, warehouse inventory where
individual data items represent items on stock). We can recapitulate
each business day by setting up regular snapshots and batch jobs.
However, there is more value hiding in the freshest data &mdash; our
business can win by reacting to minute-old or even second-old updates.
To get there we must make a shift from the finite to the infinite: from
the snapshot to a continuous influx of events that update our state of
knowledge. For example, an event could pop up in our stream every time
an item is checked in or out of the warehouse.

A single word that captures the above story is _latency_: we want our
system to minimize the latency from observing an event to acting upon
it.

=== Windowing

In an unbounded stream, the dimension of time is always there.  Consider
a batch job: it may process a dataset labeled "`Wednesday`", but the
computation itself doesn't have to know this. Its results will be
understood from the outside to be "`about Wednesday`". An endless stream,
on the other hand, delivers information about the reality as it is
unfolding, in near-real time, and the computation itself must deal with
time explicitly.

Another point: in a batch it is obvious when to stop aggregating and
emit the results: when we have exhausted the whole dataset. However,
with unbounded streams we need a policy on how to select bounded chunks
whose aggregate results we are interested in. This is called
_windowing_. We imagine the window as a time interval laid over the time
axis. A given window contains only the events that belong to that
interval.

A very basic type of window is the _tumbling window_, which can be
imagined to advance by tumbling over each time. There is no overlap
between the successive positions of the window. In other words, it
splits the time-series data into batches delimited by points on the time
axis. The result of this is very similar to running a sequence of batch
jobs, one per time interval.

A more useful and powerful policy is the _sliding window_: instead of
splitting the data at fixed boundaries, it lets it roll in
incrementally, new data gradually displacing the old. The window
(pseudo)continuously slides along the time axis.

Another popular policy is called the _session window_ and it's used to
detect bursts of activity by correlating events bunched together on the
time axis. In an analogy to a user's session with a web application,
the session window "`closes`" when the specified session timeout elapses
with no further events.

[[time-ordering]]
=== Time Ordering and the Watermark

Usually the time of observing an event is explicitly written in a field
of the stream item. There is no guarantee that items will occur in the
stream ordered by the value of that field; in fact in many cases it is
certain that they won't. Consider events gathered from users of a mobile
app: for all kinds of reasons the items will arrive to our datacenter
out of order, even with significant delays due to connectivity issues.

This disorder in the event stream makes it more difficult to formally
specify a rule that tells us at which point all the data for a given
window has been gathered, allowing us to emit the aggregated result.

To approach these challenges we use the concept of the
{jet-javadoc}/core/Watermark.html[_watermark_].
It is a timestamped item Jet inserts into the stream that says "from
this point on there will be no more items with timestamp less than
this". Unfortunately, we almost never know for sure when such a
statement becomes true and there is always a chance some events will
arrive even later. If we do observe such an offending item, we must
categorize it as "`too late`" and just filter it out.

Note the tension in defining the "`perfect`" watermark for a given use
case: it is bad both the more we wait and the less we wait to emit a
given watermark. The more we wait, the higher the latency of getting the
results of the computation; the less we wait, the worse their accuracy
due to missed events.

For these reasons Jet cannot determine the watermark on its own, you
must decide how much disorder to accept (and expect).

== Sliding and Tumbling Window

Many quantities, like "`the current rate of change of a price`" require
you to aggregate your data over some time period. This is what makes the
sliding window so important: it tracks the value of such a quantity in
real time.

Calculating a single sliding window result can be quite computationally
intensive, but we also expect it to slide smoothly and give a new result
often, even many times per second. This is why we gave special attention
to optimizing this computation.

We optimize especially heavily for those aggregate operations that have
a cheap way of combining partial results and even more so for those
which can cheaply undo the combining. For cheap combining you have to
express your operation in terms of a commutative and associative (CA for
short) function; to undo a combine you need the notion of "`negating`" an
argument to the function. A great many operations can be expressed
through CA functions: average, variance, standard deviation and linear
regression are some examples. All of these also support the undoing
(which we call _deduct_). The computation of extreme values (min/max) is
an example that has CA, but no good notion of negation and thus doesn't
support deducting.

This is the way we leverage the above properties: our sliding window
actually "`hops`" in fixed-size steps. The length of the window is an
integer multiple of the step size. Under such a definition, the
_tumbling_ window becomes just a special case with one step per window.

This allows us to divide the timestamp axis into _frames_ of equal
length and assign each event to its frame. Instead of keeping the event
object, we immediately pass it to the aggregate operation's _accumulate_
primitive. To compute a sliding window, we take all the frames covered
by it and combine them. Finally, to compute the next window, we just
_deduct_ the trailing frame and _combine_ the leading frame into the
existing result.

Even without _deduct_ the above process is much cheaper than the most
naïve approach where you'd keep all data and recompute everything from
scratch each time. After accumulating an item just once, the rest of the
process has fixed cost regardless of input size. With _deduct_, the
fixed cost approaches zero.

=== Example: 30-second Window Sliding by 10 Seconds

We'll now illustrate the above story with a specific example: we'll
construct a 30-second window which slides by 10 seconds (i.e., three
steps per window). The aggregate operation is to simply count the number
of events. In the diagrams we label the events as _minutes:seconds_.
This is the outline of the process:

1. Throw each event into its "`bucket`" (the frame whose time interval it
belongs to).
2. Instead of keeping the items in the frame, just keep the item count.
3. Combine the frames into three different positions of the sliding
window, yielding the final result: the number of events that occurred
within the window's timespan.

image::windowing-frames.png[Grouping disordered events by frame and then to sliding window,800,800,align="center"]


This would be a useful interpretation of the results: "At the time 1:30,
the 30-second running average was 8/30 = 0.27 events per second. Over
the next 20 seconds it increased to 10/30 = 0.33 events per second."

Keep in mind that the whole diagram represents what happens on just one
cluster member and for just one grouping key. The same process is going
on simultaneously for all the keys on all the members.

=== Two-stage aggregation

The concept of frame combining helps us implement two-stage aggregation
as well. In the first stage the individual members come up with their
partial results by frame and send them over a distributed edge to the
second stage, which combines the frames with the same timestamp. After
having combined all the partial frames from members, it combines the
results along the event time axis into the sliding window.

image::combining-frames.png[Combining partial frames in two-stage aggregation,800,800,align="center"]

== Session Window

In the abstract sense, the session window is a quite intuitive concept:
it simply captures a burst of events. If no new events occur within the
configured session timeout, the window closes. However, because the Jet
processor encounters events out of their original order, this kind of
window becomes quite tricky to compute.

The way Jet computes the session windows is easiest to explain in terms
of the _event interval_: the range
`[eventTimestamp, eventTimestamp + sessionTimeout]`.
Initially an event causes a new session window to be created, covering
exactly the event interval.

image::session-window-1.png[Session window: single event,250,200,align="center"]


A following event under the same key belongs to this window iff its
interval overlaps it. The window is extended to cover the entire
interval of the new event.

image::session-window-2.png[Session window: extend with another event,150,120,align="center"]

If the event intervals don't overlap, Jet creates new session window for
the new event.

image::session-window-3.png[Session window: create a new window after session timeout,300,110,align="center"]

An event may happen to belong to two existing windows if its interval
bridges the gap between them; in that case they are combined into one.

image::session-window-4.png[Session window: an event may merge two existing windows,300,110,align="center"]


Once the watermark has passed the closing time of a session window, Jet
can close it and emit the result of its aggregation.

== Fault Tolerance and Processing Guarantees

One less-than-obvious consequence of stepping up from finite to infinite
streams is the difficulty of forever maintaining the continuity of the
output, even in the face of changing cluster topology. A Jet node may
leave the cluster due to an internal error, loss of networking, or
deliberate shutdown for maintenance. This will cause the computation job
to be suspended. Except for the obvious problem of new data pouring in
while we're down, we have a much more fiddly issue of restarting the
computation in a differently laid-out cluster exactly where it left off
and neither miss anything nor process it twice. The technical term for
this is the "exactly-once processing guarantee".

Jet achieves fault tolerance in streaming jobs by making a snapshot of
the internal processing state at regular intervals. If a member of the
cluster fails while a job is running, Jet will detect this and restart
the job on the new cluster topology. It will restore its internal state
from the snapshot and tell the source to start sending data from the
last "`committed`" position (where the snapshot was taken). The data
source must have built-in support to replay the data from the given
checkpoint. The sink must either support transactions or be
_idempotent_, tolerating duplicate submission of data.

In a Jet cluster, one member is the _coordinator_. It tells other
members what to do and they report to it any status changes. The
coordinator may fail and the cluster will automatically re-elect another
one. If any other member fails, the coordinator restarts the job on the
remaining members.

== Update a DAG Without Losing the State

If you need to do a change in the pipeline or DAG, you need to submit a
new job. The old job has to be cancelled and a new one with modified
pipeline has to be submitted. To preserve the state, you have to export
it before you cancel the old job and start the new job with the exported
state.

There are 2 ways of exporting the state:

- {jet-javadoc}/Job.html#cancelAndExportSnapshot-java.lang.String-[`Job.cancelAndExportSnapshot(String name)`]:
exports a snapshot and cancels the job. This method is useful for starting
the job anew with an updated pipeline

- {jet-javadoc}/Job.html#exportSnapshot-java.lang.String-[`Job.exportSnapshot(String
name)`]: exports a snapshot and keeps the job running. Useful for
forking the job, for example in A/B testing scenario or for moving the
state to the test environment

[source]

include::{javasource}/JobUpdate.java[tag=s1]
----

=== State Compatibility

The state has to be compatible with the updated pipeline. The snapshot
contains separate data for each vertex, identified by the vertex name.
If a snapshot doesn't contain data for a vertex, it will be restored
with an empty state. If a snapshot contains data for a vertex that does
not exist, that data will be ignored. If the vertex name matches, then
it depends on the specific processor type what type of change is
allowed.

From this follows:

- you can add and new stateful stages and remove existing ones without
breaking compatibility. This includes adding/removing a source or sink
or adding a new aggregation path from existing sources (see also
<<non-unique-name-update>>).

- you can freely add, remove or change stateless stages, such as
filter/map/flatMap stages, sinks and others

==== Recombining the Frames of Sliding Windows

Jet supports changing of sliding window size or sliding step. In some
situations, however, you can have incorrect data on the output.

Sliding windows in Jet accumulate input items into _frames_ (see
<<sliding-and-tumbling-window>>). The frame size is equal to the slide
step of the window. The processor saves the
{jet-javadoc}/aggregate/AggregateOperation.html#createFn--[aggregation's
accumulator] to the snapshot, one for each key and frame.

If the slide step changes, the frames in the snapshot won't match those
needed for the new slide step. You can do this change, but the frames will
be recombined into new frames based on their end timestamps.

.Example recombining 10-second frames into 15-second frames
image::recombining-frames.png[Recombining restored frames,600,175,align="center"]

As you see on the figure, frame `1:10` will be put into frame `1:15`.
Frames `1:20` and `1:30` will be
{jet-javadoc}/aggregate/AggregateOperation.html#combineFn--[combined]
into frame `1:30`. This means that events with timestamp between `1:10` to
`1:15` will be incorrectly accumulated into frame `1:15`-`1:30`.

You also can extend the window size, but the first emitted windows after
restoring will miss older events. The reason for this is that the frames
were already purged, see the image:

.Example extending window size
image::extending-window-size.png[Example extending window size,600,279,align="center"]

In the example above, the 20-second window was extended to a 30-second
one, sliding step (i.e. frame size) was unchanged. As you see, the
frames after restore match the frames when the snapshot was saved, so no
recombining will occur. However, the next window to emit at `1:30` will
miss events between `0:50`-`1:00`, because the frame containing them was
already purged because it wasn't needed for the original 20-second
window. The window at `1:40` will be correct. Reducing the window size
has no such issue.

==== State Compatibility of Other Processors

Here are examples of other supported changes to the parameters of
pipeline stages. For details, consult the javadoc of each stage.

* change session window timeout
* change connection parameters of sources/sinks
* change parameters of aggregate operation: for example, change the
comparator of `AggregateOperation.minBy()`
* replace the aggregate operation, if the accumulator type is the same:
for example, change `counting()` to `summingLong()`, if that makes sense
* any change to stateless stages

The following changes are not supported:

* change a sliding window to a session window
* replace aggregation operation for one with incompatible accumulator
type
* assign a different name to a stage

[[non-unique-name-update]]
==== Update a Job with Auto-Assigned Stage Names

The Pipeline API allows you to set the name of a stage using
{jet-javadoc}/pipeline/Stage.html#setName-java.lang.String-[`Stage.setName`],
but if you don't set it, Jet generates the name based on the stage type.
If this would result in the same name for multiple stages, Jet appends
`-N` to the name, where the `N` is a sequence number. For example, if
you have 3 sliding window aggregations in the job, their names will be
`sliding-window`, `sliding-window-2` and `sliding-window-3`. The number
sequence follows the order in which you added the stages to the
`Pipeline`.

When Jet translates the pipeline into the Core API DAG, it uses the
name of the stage to name the vertex that implements it. Since the
vertex name identifies the data element in the state snapshot, it's very
important to keep it equal when you change the pipeline to a new version.
For example, you can't reorder the aggregations or remove the first one
because that would change the names and incorrect state will be restored
to the vertex. Therefore we recommend that you explicitly assign a
unique name to every stage in the pipeline you intend to use and
maintain over a long term.

==== Caveats When Changing the Grouping Key

You can change the key-extracting function for a `groupingKey`'s, but
keep in mind that the snapshotted state has keys extracted with the old
key extractor. If the new keys aren't equal, they will create new groups.

You can also change the key type. In this case, however, the job may
fail with a `ClassCastException` because the downstream might expect a
different type than it will actually receive. For example, if you change
the key type from `Integer` to `Long`, the downstream stage of a window
aggregation will expect `KeyedWindowResult<Long, V>`, but can actually
get `KeyedWindowResult<Integer, V>`.

==== State compatibility with Further Versions

Jet does not guarantee snapshot compatibility between major releases.
Snapshot created in older version might not work in newer major version.
Bugfix releases are compatible.

[[jet-execution-model]]
== Jet's Execution Model

At the heart of Jet is the {jet-core}/TaskletExecutionService.java[`TaskletExecutionService`].
It manages the threads that perform all the computation in a Jet job.
Although this class is not formally a part of Jet's public API,
understanding how it schedules code for execution is essential if you
want to implement a cooperative processor.

[[cooperative-multithreading]]
=== Cooperative Multithreading

Cooperative multithreading is one of the core features of Jet and can be
roughly compared to
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_threads[green threads].
It is purely a library-level feature and does not involve any low-level
system or JVM tricks; the `Processor` API is simply designed in such a
way that the processor can do a small amount of work each time it is
invoked, then yield back to the Jet engine. The engine manages a thread
pool of fixed size and on each thread, the processors take their turn in
a round-robin fashion.

The point of cooperative multithreading is better performance. Several
factors contribute to this:

- The overhead of context switching between processors is much lower
since the operating system's thread scheduler is not involved.
- The worker thread driving the processors stays on the same core for
longer periods, preserving the CPU cache lines.
- The worker thread has direct knowledge of the ability of a processor
to make progress (by inspecting its input/output buffers).

[[tasklet]]
=== Tasklet

The execution service doesn't deal with processors directly; instead it
deals with _tasklets_.
{jet-core}/impl/execution/Tasklet.java[`Tasklet`] is a very simple
functional interface derived from the standard Java `Callable<ProgressState>`.
The execution service manages a pool of worker threads, each being
responsible for a list of tasklets. The worker thread simply invokes the
`call()` methods on its tasklets in a round-robin fashion. The method's
return value tells whether the tasklet made progress and whether it is
now done.

The most important tasklet is the one driving a processor
(`ProcessorTasklet`); there are a few others that deal with network
sending/receiving and taking snapshots.

[[exponential-backoff]]
=== Exponential Backoff

If none of the worker's tasklets report having made progress, the worker
will go to a short sleep. If this happens again after it wakes up, it
will sleep for twice as long. Once it reaches 1 ms sleep time, it will
continue retrying once per millisecond to see if any tasklets can make
progress.

[[processor-tasklet]]
=== ProcessorTasklet

{jet-core}/impl/execution/ProcessorTasklet.java[`ProcessorTasklet`]
is the one that drives a processor. It manages its inbox, outbox,
inbound/outbound concurrent queues, and tracks the current processor
state so it knows which of its callback methods to call.

During each `tasklet.call()`, `ProcessorTasklet` makes one call into
one of its processor's callbacks. It determines the processor's progress
status and reports it to the execution service.

[[non-cooperative-processor]]
=== Non-Cooperative Processor

If a processor declares itself as non-cooperative, the execution service
will start a dedicated Java thread for its tasklet to run on.

Even if it's non-cooperative, the processor's callback methods must
still make sure they don't run for longer than a second or so at a time.
Jet can't start a snapshot until all the processors have yielded control
back to it.

[[running-a-jet-job]]
== What Happens When you Submit a Job

When you submit a `Job` to it, Jet replicates the DAG to the whole Jet
cluster and executes a copy of it on each member.

image::dag-distribution.png[DAG Distribution]

Jet executes the job on a user-configurable number of threads which use
work stealing to balance the amount of work being done on each thread.
Each worker thread has a list of tasklets it is in charge of and as
tasklets complete at different rates, the remaining ones are moved
between workers to keep the load balanced.

Each instance of a `Processor` is wrapped in one tasklet which the
execution service repeatedly executes until it is done. A vertex with a
parallelism of 8 running on 4 members would have a total of 32 tasklets
running at the same time. Each member has the same number of tasklets
running.

image::parallelism-model.png[Tasklet execution model,800,400]

When you make a request to execute a Job, the corresponding DAG and
additional resources are deployed to the Jet cluster. Jet builds an
execution plan for the DAG on each member, which creates the associated
tasklets for each Vertex and connects them to their inputs and outputs.

Jet uses Single Producer/Single Consumer ringbuffers to transfer the
data between processors on the same member. They are data-type agnostic,
so any data type can be used to transfer the data between vertices.

Ringbuffers, being bounded queues, introduce natural backpressure into
the system; if a consumer’s ringbuffer is full, the producer will have
to back off until it can enqueue the next item. When data is sent to
another member over the network, there is no natural backpressure, so
Jet uses explicit signaling in the form of adaptive receive windows.

== Distributed Snapshot

The technique Jet uses to achieve
<<fault-tolerance-and-processing-guarantees, fault tolerance>>
is called a "`distributed snapshot`", described in a
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Determining-Global-States-of-a-Distributed-System.pdf[paper by Chandy and Lamport].
At regular intervals, Jet raises a global flag that says "it's time for
another snapshot". All processors belonging to source vertices observe
the flag, create a checkpoint on their source, emit a barrier item
to the downstream processors and resume processing.

As the barrier item reaches a processor, it stops what it's doing and
emits its state to the snapshot storage. Once complete, it forwards the
barrier item to its downstream processors.

Due to parallelism, in most cases a processor receives data from more
than one upstream processor. It will receive the barrier item from each
of them at separate times, but it must start taking a snapshot at a
single point in time. There are two approaches it can take, as explained
below.

=== Exactly-Once Snapshotting

With _exactly-once_ configured, as soon as the processor gets a barrier
item in any input stream (from any upstream processor), it must stop
consuming it until it gets the same barrier item in all the streams:

image::exactly-once-1.png[Exactly-once processing: received one barrier,300,110,align="center"]

1. At the barrier in stream X, but not Y. Must not accept any more X
items.
+
image::exactly-once-2.png[Exactly-once processing: received both barriers,300,110,align="center"]
+
2. At the barrier in both streams, taking a snapshot.
+
image::exactly-once-3.png[Exactly-once processing: forward the barrier,300,110,align="center"]
+
3. Snapshot done, barrier forwarded. Can resume consuming all streams.

=== At-Least-Once Snapshotting

With _at-least-once_ configured, the processor can keep consuming all
the streams until it gets all the barriers, at which point it will stop
to take the snapshot:

image::at-least-once-1.png[At-Least-once processing: received one barrier,300,110,align="center"]

1. At the barrier in stream X, but not Y. Carry on consuming all
streams.
+
image::at-least-once-2.png[At-Least-once processing: received both barriers,300,110,align="center"]
+
2. At the barrier in both streams, already consumed `x1` and `x2`.
Taking a snapshot.
+
image::at-least-once-3.png[At-Least-once processing: forward the barrier,300,110,align="center"]
+
3. Snapshot done, barrier forwarded.


Even though `x1` and `x2` occur after the barrier, the processor
consumed and processed them, updating its state accordingly. If the
computation job stops and restarts, this state will be restored from the
snapshot and then the source will replay `x1` and `x2`. The processor
will think it got two new items.

== Dropped Late Events

At times, you might encounter a line like the following in your logs:

```plain
Event dropped, late by 123ms. currentWatermark=14:23:10.256, eventTime=14:23:10.123, event=FooEvent
```

The most obvious cause to check is to make sure that there are no two
events `E1` and `E2` in any source partition where `E2` is positioned
after `E1` in the stream and `E1.timestamp - allowedLag > E2.timestamp`.

Besides this obvious reason, there are few more possible causes:

- If timestamps are not added in source, source streams might be split
and merged in an unpredictable way. See
<<caveats-of-not-adding-timestamps-in-source>>. Also Map Journal and
Cache Journal sources currently don't coalesce watermarks in source,
they fall into this category too.

- Source partitions can be marked as idle. The idle timeout is hardcoded
for pipeline api to
{jet-javadoc}/core/EventTimePolicy.html#DEFAULT_IDLE_TIMEOUT[`DEFAULT_IDLE_TIMEOUT`].
If the partition isn't really idle, but rather is stalled, after it
resumes, events from it can be late because it was excluded from
coalescing.

_Note:_ items are not dropped unless there is need to. For example,
`map` operation never drops items, even if they come late. Currently
only windowing aggregations drop events, because they purge data from
memory as the event time passes.

== Stream Skew

We <<time-ordering, explained>> how we use the concept of watermark to
impose order onto a disordered data stream. However, items arriving out
of order aren't our only challenge; modern stream sources like Kafka are
partitioned and distributed so "`the stream`" is actually a set of
independent substreams, moving on in parallel. Substantial time
difference may arise between events being processed on each one, but our
system must produce coherent output as if there was only one stream. We
meet this challenge by coalescing watermarks: as the data travels over a
partitioned/distributed edge, we make sure the downstream processor
observes the correct watermark value, which is the least of watermarks
received from the contributing substreams.

=== Rules of Watermark Propagation

Watermark objects are sent interleaved with other stream items, but are
handled specially:

* The value of the watermark a processor emits must be strictly
  increasing. Jet will throw an exception if it detects a non-increasing
  watermark.

* When a processor receives a watermark, it should add it to the outbox.
  The processor is allowed to delay the watermark: for example, if the
  processor does async mapping, it should emit the watermark after it
  received responses for all items that came before it. Sink processors
  don't have to emit watermarks.

* The watermark item is always broadcast, regardless of the edge type.
  This means that all N upstream processors send their watermark to all
  M downstream processors.

* The processor will observe only a watermark that was received from
  all upstream processors and from all upstream edges. This is called
  _watermark coalescing_.

Jet's internal class
{jet-core}/impl/execution/WatermarkCoalescer.java[`WatermarkCoalescer`]
manages watermarks received from multiple inputs. As it receives
watermark items from them, its duty is to decide when to forward the
watermark downstream. This happens at two levels:

* between multiple queues backing single edge
* between multiple input edges to single processor

=== Idle inputs

A special object called _idle message_ can be emitted from source
processor when the processor sees no events for configured _idle
timeout_. This can happen in real life when some external partitions
have no events while others do.

When an _idle message_ is received from an input, that input will be
excluded from watermark coalescing. This means that we will not wait to
receive watermark from the idle input. It will allow the other active
inputs to be processed without further delay. When the idle timeout is
disabled and some processor doesn't emit any watermarks (because it sees
no events), the processing will stall indefinitely.

[[pitfalls-alo]]
== The Pitfalls of At-Least-Once Processing

In some cases _at-least-once_ semantics can have consequences of quite
an unexpected magnitude, as we discuss next.

=== Apparent Data Loss

Imagine a very simple kind of processor: it matches up the items that
belong to a _pair_ based on some rule. If it receives item A first, it
remembers it. Later on, when it receives item B, it emits that fact
to its outbound edge and forgets about the two items. It may also first
receive B and wait for A.

Now imagine this sequence: `A -> BARRIER -> B`. In at-least-once the
processor may observe both A and B, emit its output, and forget about
them, all before taking the snapshot. After the restart, item B will be
replayed because it occurred after the last barrier, but item A won't.
Now the processor is stuck forever in a state where it's expecting A and
has no idea it already got it and emitted that fact.

Problems similar to this may happen with any state the processor keeps
until it has got enough information to emit the results and then forgets
it. By the time it takes a snapshot, the post-barrier items will have
caused it to forget facts about some pre-barrier items. After a restart
it will behave as though it has never observed those pre-barrier items,
resulting in behavior equivalent to data loss.

=== Non-Monotonic Watermark

One special case of the above story concerns watermark items. Thanks to
watermark coalescing, processors are typically implemented against the
invariant that the watermark value always increases. However, in
_at-least-once_ the post-barrier watermark items will advance the
processor's watermark value. After the job restarts and the state gets
restored to the snapshotted point, the watermark will appear to have
gone back, breaking the invariant. This can again lead to apparent data
loss.
