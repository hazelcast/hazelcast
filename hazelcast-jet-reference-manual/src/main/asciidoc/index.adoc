= Hazelcast Jet Reference Manual
Version {jet-version}

Welcome to the Hazelcast Jet Reference Manual. This manual includes
concepts, instructions, and samples to guide you on how to use Hazelcast
Jet to build and execute computation jobs.

As the reader of this manual you should be familiar with the Java
programming language.

= Summary of Contents

. <<overview, Overview>> presents the basic concepts of Hazelcast Jet
and provides high-level orientation.

. <<get-started>> leads you through the steps to get Hazelcast Jet up
and running on your machine. You can copy-paste the provided code to
execute your first Jet job.

. <<work-with-jet>> show you how to configure Jet, start a Jet cluster,
manage jobs, etc.

. <<pipeline-api>> introduces Jet's Pipeline API. This is the API you
use to build the computation you want Jet to execute.

. <<source-sink-connectors>> presents the source and sink connectors
that Jet provides.

. <<configuration>> explains how to configure Jet. You can tune its
performance, level of safety in fault-tolerant jobs, configure the
underlying IMDG cluster, etc.

. <<concepts>> presents some fundamental concepts that
make Jet work. Understanding them will help you get the most of
Hazelcast Jet.

. <<expert-zone>> presents the material you need to understand if you
want to successfully use the Core API. You don't need this knowledge to
use Jet. It is relevant only if you plan to implement custom processors
or build the DAG by directly using the Core API.
