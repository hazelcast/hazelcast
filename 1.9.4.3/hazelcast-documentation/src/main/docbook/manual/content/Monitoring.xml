    Cluster Monitoring Tool is a simple web application (war file) that enables you to monitor your running Hazelcast
    cluster. It is distributed with Hazelcast as of 1.8.1 version.
    It is not using JMX, so the effect to your running cluster is negligible. You can only monitor cluster that runs the
    same version of Hazelcast. In order to use it, you should first upgrade to 1.8.1 and then use the tool.
    To use it
    1. Download hazelcast-`&lt;`version`&gt;`.zip.
    2. Locate hazelcast-monitor-`&lt;`version`&gt;`.war under main directory of unzipped directory.
    3. Deploy it to your web container. For Tomcat, simply copy the war file to webapps directory.
    4. Go to http://localhost:8080/hazelcast-monitor-1.8.1/
    5. You need to add a cluster to monitor.
    [http://www.hazelcast.com/resources/monitor-login.png]
    To add a cluster, type
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para>cluster-group-name (default is dev),
            </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>cluster-group-password (default is dev-pass)
            </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>ip:port of the one of the members.(ex 10.10.1.1, 10.10.1.2:5702). Default port is 5701.
            </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>and press Add Cluster button.
            </para>
        </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    Note that you can add more than one cluster to monitor.
    [http://www.hazelcast.com/resources/monitor-cluster-view.png]
    You can see
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para>Cluster members
            </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Map, Queue, ... instances. On 1.8.1 only Map instances can be monitored.
            </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Internals
            </para>
        </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    6. Expand Maps tree and click on any map instance. If you can't see any instance then your cluster does not use any
    map.

    On right side following panels will be displayed
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Charts</emphasis>:
                When you click on a map instance you will see two charts displaying:
                # Size&amp;Memory
                # Throughput chart
            </para>
        </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    _Size&amp; Memory_
    It shows the number of entries in your map and the memory that those entries occupy. The values are aggregation of
    all members. To see the details, like how the entries are partitioned among members, see Size&amp;Memory Details
    panel.
    _Throughput_
    This chart shows how many map operations per second your cluster is doing in total. Again it is aggregation of all
    members. To see how each member is doing see Throughput Details panel.
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para>*Table Panels*:
                Under charts there is three table panels.
                # Throughput Details
                # Size&amp;Memory Details
                # Times Details
            </para>
        </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    These tables show you the details per member.
    _Throughput Details_
    Shows the number of map operations;gets, puts, removes and others per second for each member.
    _Size&amp;Memory Details_
    Displays how your entries are partitioned among members. How many entries and backups each member owns. In Hazelcast
    the preceding member is the backup of the previous. So you can watch how your entries are backed up and what happens
    when a member leaves the cluster. If your cluster is doing lots of puts and removes, you will notice that the owned
    and backup numbers will not exactly match.
    This doesn't mean that Hazelcast does not backup properly. The mismatch happens because tool makes a call to each
    node, asking their internal details. It is a distributed task and not all members reply at the same time. That's why
    the numbers may not be exactly same. But they should be very very close.
    Also notice the marked as remove part. When you remove an entry, hazelcast will mark it as removed but will delay
    the actual removal process. Those columns show number of entries waiting for removal and their memory size.
    You also can see total number of locked entries on each member and total number of threads at all members waiting
    for those entries.
    _Times Details_
    This table displays several timing details on each member.
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para>*Map Browser*
                Enables you to perform get operation on the map. Gives the details of the entry. To browse the map the
                key of your map have to be String. See the picture for more details.
            </para>
