Files in this folder were generated using `create_keymaterial_openssl`
 script. 

If you don't have access to it, you can generate files using combination of `openssl` and `keytool` command. 
You should use `pkcs12` key stores.

Only unusual file is the `localhost.p12` file. It must contain client certificate and then the private key.
