    /**
     * Returns a source that consumes one or more Apache Kafka topics and emits
     * items from them as {@code Map.Entry} instances.
     * <p>
     * The source creates a {@code KafkaConsumer} for each {@link Processor}
     * instance using the supplied {@code properties}. It assigns a subset of
     * Kafka partitions to each of them using manual partition assignment (it
     * ignores the {@code group.id} property). The Kafka's message timestamp
     * will be used as a {@linkplain StreamSourceStage#withNativeTimestamps(long)
     * native timestamp}.
     * <p>
     * If snapshotting is enabled, partition offsets are saved to the snapshot.
     * After a restart, the source emits the events from the same offsets.
     * <p>
     * If you start a new job from an exported state, you can change the source
     * parameters as needed:<ul>
     *     <li>if you add a topic, it will be consumed from the default position
     *     <li>if you remove a topic, restored offsets for that topic will be
     *     ignored (there will be a warning logged)
     *     <li>if you connect to another cluster, the offsets will be used based
     *     on the equality of the topic name. If you want to start from default
     *     position, give different {@linkplain Stage#setName name} to this
     *     source
     *     <li>if the partition count is lower after a restart, the extra
     *     offsets will be ignored
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * The source can work in two modes:
     * <ol>
     *     <li>if {@linkplain JobConfig#setProcessingGuarantee processing
     *     guarantee} is enabled, offsets are stored to the snapshot and after a
     *     restart or failure, the reading continues from the saved offset. You
     *     can achieve exactly-once or at-least-once behavior.
     *
     *     <li>if processing guarantee is disabled, the source will start
     *     reading from default offsets (based on the {@code auto.offset.reset}
     *     property). You can enable offset committing by assigning a {@code
     *     group.id}, enabling auto offset committing using {@code
     *     enable.auto.commit} and configuring {@code auto.commit.interval.ms}
     *     in the given properties. Refer to Kafka documentation for the
     *     descriptions of these properties.
     * </ol>
     *
     * If you add Kafka partitions at run-time, consumption from them will
     * start after a delay, based on the {@code metadata.max.age.ms} Kafka
     * property. Note, however, that events from them can be dropped as late if
     * the allowed lag is not large enough.
     * <p>
     * The processor never completes, it can only fail in the case of an error.
     * However, IO failures are generally handled by Kafka producer and do not
     * cause the processor to fail. Kafka consumer also does not return from
     * {@code poll(timeout)} if the cluster is down. If {@link
     * JobConfig#setSnapshotIntervalMillis(long) snapshotting is enabled},
     * entire job might be blocked. This is a known issue of Kafka
     * (KAFKA-1894, now fixed). Refer to Kafka documentation for details.
     * <p>
     * The default local parallelism for this processor is 4 (or less if less CPUs
     * are available). Note that deserialization is done inside {@code
     * KafkaConsumer}. If you have high traffic, the deserialization might
     * become a bottleneck - increase the local parallelism or use {@code
     * byte[]} for messages and deserialize manually in a subsequent mapping
     * step.
     *
     * @param properties consumer properties broker address and key/value
     *                  deserializers
     * @param projectionFn function to create output objects from the Kafka record.
     *                    If the projection returns a {@code null} for an item,
     *                    that item will be filtered out.
     * @param topics the topics to consume, at least one is required
