### JCache Near Cache

Cache entries in Hazelcast are stored as partitioned across the cluster. 
When you try to read a record with key `k`, if the current node is not the owner of that key (not the owner of partition that the key belongs to), 
a remote operation is sent to the owner node. So each remote operation means lots of network trips. 
If your cache is used for reading generally, it is advised to use a near-cache storage in front of cache itself for reading cache records faster and consume less network traffic.
Also note that near-cache is **only available for clients** not servers.

However, using near-cache comes with some trade-off for some cases:
-   There will be extra the memory consumption for storing near-cache records at local.
-   If invalidation is enabled and entries are updated frequently, there will be many invalidation events across the cluster.
-   Near-Cache doesn't give strong consistency but gives eventual consistency guarantees. It is possible to read stale data.

#### Expiration

Expiration means that evicting expired records. 
So a record is expired, 
- If it is not touched (accessed/read) during `<max-idle-seconds>`
- `<time-to-live-seconds>` passed since it is put to near-cache

Expiration are done in two cases:
- When a record is accessed, it is checked about if it is expired or not. If it is expired, it is evicted and returns `null` to caller.
- At background there is an expiration task that periodically (currently 5 seconds) scans records and evicts expired records.

#### Eviction

In Near-Cache scope, eviction means that evicting (clearing) entries selected as specified eviction policy when specified max-size policy has been reached.
Eviction is handled with max-size policy and eviction policy configurations.

##### Max-Size Policy

Max-Size policy defines the state when near-cache is full and eviction should be triggered.
The following max-size policies are supported by near-cache eviction:
- **ENTRY_COUNT:** Decides maximum based on the count of the number of entries in the near-cache. 
Available only for `BINARY` and `OBJECT` in-memory formats.
- **USED_NATIVE_MEMORY_SIZE:** Decides maximum used native memory size in MB of the specified near-cache to trigger eviction. 
If used native memory size by the specified near-cache exceeds this threshold, eviction is done. 
Available only for `NATIVE` in-memory format (supported only by Enterprise module).
- **USED_NATIVE_MEMORY_PERCENTAGE:** Decides maximum used native memory percentage of the specified near-cache to trigger eviction. 
If used native memory percentage (relative to maximum native memory size) by the specified near-cache exceeds this threshold, eviction is done. 
Available only for `NATIVE` in-memory format (supported only by Enterprise module).
- **FREE_NATIVE_MEMORY_SIZE:** Decides minimum free native memory size in MB of the specified near-cache to trigger eviction. 
If free native memory size by the specified near-cache goes down below of this threshold, eviction is done.
Available only for `NATIVE` in-memory format (supported only by Enterprise module).
- **FREE_NATIVE_MEMORY_PERCENTAGE:** Decides minimum free native memory percentage of the specified near-cache to trigger eviction. 
If free native memory percentage (relative to maximum native memory size) by the specified near-cache goes down below of this threshold, eviction is done.
Available only for `NATIVE` in-memory format (supported only by Enterprise module).

##### Eviction Policy 
Once a near-cache is full (reached to its max size as specified with max-size policy), an eviction policy determines which, if any, entries must be evicted.
Currently, the following eviction policies are supported by near-cache eviction: 
- LRU
- LFU

#### Configuration

Here are properties of near-cache configuration:
- **In Memory Format:** Defines the storage type of near cache entries. Valid values are `BINARY`, `OBJECT` and `NATIVE_MEMORY`. `NATIVE_MEMORY` is only available for enterprise module. Default value is `BINARY`.
- **Cache Local Entries:** Defines should the local cache entries be stored eagerly (immediately) to near cache on cache put from local. Valid values are `true` and `false`. Default value is `false`.
- **Invalidate on Change:** Defines should the cached entries be evicted if the entries are changed (updated or removed) from local and global also. Valid values are `true` and `false`. Default value is `true`.
- **Time to Live Seconds:** Maximum number of seconds for each entry to stay in the near cache. Entries that are older than `<time-to-live-seconds>` will get automatically evicted from the near cache. Any integer between `0` and `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. `0` means **infinite**. Default value is `0`.
- **Max Idle Seconds:** Maximum number of seconds each entry can stay in the near cache as untouched (not-read). Entries that are not read (touched) more than `<max-idle-seconds>` value will get removed from the near cache. Any integer between `0` and `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. `0` means `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. Default is `0`.
- **Eviction:** Eviction configuration about when eviction is triggered (max-size policy) and which eviction policy (`LRU` or `LFU`) will be used for selecting evicted entry. As default value, max-size policy is `ENTRY_COUNT`, size is `10000` and eviction policy is `LRU`. For HD Near-Cache since `ENTRY_COUNT` eviction policy is not supported yet, eviction must be explicitly configured with one of the supported policies `USED_NATIVE_MEMORY_SIZE`, `USED_NATIVE_MEMORY_PERCENTAGE`, `FREE_NATIVE_MEMORY_SIZE` and `FREE_NATIVE_MEMORY_PERCENTAGE`.

Near-Cache can be configured only at client side.

Here is a declarative near-cache configuration for a cache named `myCache`:

```xml
<hazelcast-client>
    ...
    <near-cache name="myCache">
        <!--
            Store cache entries in "BINARY" format.
        -->
        <in-memory-format>BINARY</in-memory-format>
        <!--
            Invalidate near-cache entries when entries are changed (updated or removed) from local or global.
        -->
        <invalidate-on-change>true</invalidate-on-change>
        <!--
            Don't put local cache entries eagerly to near-cache on local cache put.
        -->
        <cache-local-entries>false</cache-local-entries>
 
        <!--
            Evict entries these are in near-cache more than 1 hour.
        -->
        <time-to-live-seconds>3600000</time-to-live-seconds>
 
        <!--
            Evict entries these are not touched (not read) more than 10 minutes.
        -->
        <max-idle-seconds>600000</max-idle-seconds>
 
        <!--
            When entry count in near-cache reaches to 1000, 
            select entry to be evicted as LFU eviction policy and evict it.
        -->
        <eviction size="1000" max-size-policy="ENTRY_COUNT" eviction-policy="LFU"/>
    </near-cache>
    ...
</hazelcast-client>
```

Here is a programmatic near-cache configuration for a cache named `myCache`:

```java
EvictionConfig evictionConfig = new EvictionConfig();
evictionConfig.setMaxSizePolicy(MaxSizePolicy.ENTRY_COUNT);
evictionConfig.setEvictionPolicy(EvictionPolicy.LFU);
evictionConfig.setSize(10000);
 
NearCacheConfig nearCacheConfig =
    new NearCacheConfig()
        .setName("myCache")
        .setInMemoryFormat(InMemoryFormat.BINARY)
        .setInvalidateOnChange(true)
        .setCacheLocalEntries(false)
        .setTimeToLiveSeconds(60 * 60 * 1000) // 1 hour TTL
        .setMaxIdleSeconds(10 * 60 * 1000) // 10 minutes max idle seconds
        .setEvictionConfig(evictionConfig);
 
...
 
clientConfig.addNearCacheConfig(nearCacheConfig);
```

#### Notes About Client Near-Cache Configuration
Near-Cache configuration can be defined at client side (`hazelcast-client.xml` or `ClientConfig`) as independent configuration (independent from `CacheConfig`). 
So at client, near-cache configuration lookup is handled like this:
- Look for near-cache configuration with name of cache at client configuration
- If there is defined near-cache configuration found, use this near-cache configuration defined at client
- Otherwise, 
  * If there is defined default near-cache configuration found, use this default near-cache configuration
  * Otherwise, this means that, there is no near-cache configuration for cache
