## Logging Configuration

Hazelcast has a flexible logging configuration and does not depend on any logging framework except JDK logging. It has in-built adaptors for a number of logging frameworks and also supports custom loggers by providing logging interfaces.

To use built-in adaptors, you should set `hazelcast.logging.type` property to one of predefined types below.

-   **jdk**: JDK logging (default)

-   **log4j**: Log4j

-   **slf4j**: Slf4j

-   **none**: disable logging

You can set `hazelcast.logging.type` through declarative configuration, programmatic configuration or JVM system property.

**Declarative Configuration**

```xml
<hazelcast xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/config
    http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/config/hazelcast-config-3.0.xsd"
    xmlns="http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/config"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">

  ....

  <properties>
    <property name="hazelcast.logging.type">jdk</property>
    ....
  </properties>
</hazelcast>
```

**Programmatic Configuration**

```java
Config config = new Config() ;
config.setProperty( "hazelcast.logging.type", "log4j" );
```

**System Property**

	-	Using JVM parameter: `java -Dhazelcast.logging.type=slf4j`
	-	Using System class: `System.setProperty( "hazelcast.logging.type", "none" );`


If provided logging mechanisms are not satisfactory, you can implement your own using the custom logging feature. To use it, you should implement `com.hazelcast.logging.LoggerFactory` and `com.hazelcast.logging.ILogger` interfaces and set system property `hazelcast.logging.class` as your custom `LoggerFactory` class name.

```plain
-Dhazelcast.logging.class=foo.bar.MyLoggingFactory
```

You can also listen to logging events generated by Hazelcast runtime by registering `LogListener`s to `LoggingService`.

```java
LogListener listener = new LogListener() {
  public void log( LogEvent logEvent ) {
    // do something
  }
}
HazelcastInstance instance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();
LoggingService loggingService = instance.getLoggingService();
loggingService.addLogListener( Level.INFO, listener );
```
Through the `LoggingService`, you can get the currently used ILogger implementation and log your own messages, too.
