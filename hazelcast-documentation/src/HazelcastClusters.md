# Hazelcast Clusters

This chapter describes Hazelcast clusters and the ways cluster members use to form a Hazelcast cluster. 

## Hazelcast Cluster Overview

A Hazelcast cluster is a network of cluster members that run Hazelcast. Cluster members, or nodes, automatically join together to form a cluster. This automatic joining takes place with some discovery mechanisms that the cluster members use to find each other. Hazelcast uses multicast auto-discovery, IP/hostname lists and EC2 cloud discovery mechanisms. The following sections describe each mechanism.
