On top of the page, there are small charts to monitor the size, offers and polls of the selected queue in real-time. All charts' X-axis shows the current system time. And a chart can be opened as a separate dialog by clicking on the ![](images/Maximizechart.jpg) button placed at top right of each chart. Below monitoring charts are available:

-	**Size**: Monitors the size of the queue. Y-axis is the entry count (should be multiplied by 1000).
-	**Offers**: Monitors the offers sent to the selected queue. Y-axis is the offer count.
-	**Polls**: Monitors the polls sent to the selected queue. Y-axis is the poll count.


Under these charts, there are **Queue Statistics** and **Queue Operation Statistics** tables. Queue Statistics table provides item and backup item counts in the queue and age statistics of items and backup items at each node, as shown below.

The order of the listings in each column can be ascended or descended by clicking on column headings.
