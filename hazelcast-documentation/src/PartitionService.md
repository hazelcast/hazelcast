### Cluster-Member Safety Check

To prevent data loss when shutting down a node, Hazelcast provides graceful shutdown feature. This is performed by calling the method `Hazelcast.shutdown`. Once it is called, it checks the below conditions to ensure the node is safe to shutdown:

- there is no active migration
- at least one backups of partitions are synched with primary ones

Even if the above conditions are not met, then they are forced to be completed by `Hazelcast.shutdown`. Eventually, when this method returns, it means node has been brought to a safe state and it can be shutdown without any data loss. 

What if you want to be sure that your **cluster** is in a safe state? What does it mean that cluster is safe to shutdown without any data loss? 

There may be some use cases like rolling upgrades, development/testing or any logic that requires a cluster/member to be safe. To provide this, Hazelcast offers `PartitionService` interface with the methods `isClusterSafe`, `isMemberSafe`, `isLocalMemberSafe` and `forceLocalMemberToBeSafe`. These methods can also be deemed as decoupled pieces from the method `Hazelcast.shutdown`. 


```java
public interface PartitionService {
   ...
   ...
    boolean isClusterSafe();
    boolean isMemberSafe(Member member);
    boolean isLocalMemberSafe();
    boolean forceLocalMemberToBeSafe(long timeout, TimeUnit unit);
}
```

The method `isClusterSafe` checks whether the cluster is in a safe state. It returns `true` if there are no active partition migration and there are sufficient backups for each partition. Once it returns `true` it means the cluster is safe and a node can be shutdown without data loss.

The method `isMemberSafe` checks whether a specific node is in a safe state. This check controls if first backups of partitions of the given node are synched with the primary ones. Once it returns `true` it means the given node is safe and it can be shutdown without data loss. Similarly, the method `isLocalMemberSafe` does the same check for the local member. And, the method `forceLocalMemberToBeSafe` forces the owned and backup partitions to be synchronized to make the local member safe.

***NOTE:*** *These methods are available from Hazelcast 3.3.*


#### Sample Codes


```java
PartitionService partitionService = hazelcastInstance.getPartitionService().isClusterSafe()
if (partitionService().isClusterSafe()) {
  hazelcastInstance.shutdown(); // or terminate
}
```

OR 

```java
PartitionService partitionService = hazelcastInstance.getPartitionService().isClusterSafe()
if (partitionService().isLocalMemberSafe()) {
  hazelcastInstance.shutdown(); // or terminate
}
```
