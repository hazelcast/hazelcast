### Map Locks

Hazelcast Distributed Map (IMap) is thread-safe to meet your thread safety requirements. When these requirements increase or you want to have more control on the concurrency, consider the following Hazelcast features and solutions.

Let's work on a sample case as shown below.

```java
public class RacyUpdateMember {
    public static void main( String[] args ) throws Exception {
        HazelcastInstance hz = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();
        IMap<String, Value> map = hz.getMap( "map" );
        String key = "1";
        map.put( key, new Value() );
        System.out.println( "Starting" );
        for ( int k = 0; k < 1000; k++ ) {
            if ( k % 100 == 0 ) System.out.println( "At: " + k );
            Value value = map.get( key );
            Thread.sleep( 10 );
            value.amount++;
            map.put( key, value );
        }
        System.out.println( "Finished! Result = " + map.get(key).amount );
    }

    static class Value implements Serializable {
        public int amount;
    }
}
```

If the above code is run by more than one cluster member simultaneously, there will be likely a race condition. You can solve this with Hazelcast.

#### Pessimistic Locking

One way to solve the race issue is the lock mechanism provided by Hazelcast distributed map, i.e. the `map.lock` and `map.unlock` methods. You simply lock the entry until you are finished with it. See the below sample code.

```java
public class PessimisticUpdateMember {
    public static void main( String[] args ) throws Exception {
        HazelcastInstance hz = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();
        IMap<String, Value> map = hz.getMap( "map" );
        String key = "1";
        map.put( key, new Value() );
        System.out.println( "Starting" );
        for ( int k = 0; k < 1000; k++ ) {
            map.lock( key );
            try {
                Value value = map.get( key );
                Thread.sleep( 10 );
                value.amount++;
                map.put( key, value );
            } finally {
                map.unlock( key );
            }
        }
        System.out.println( "Finished! Result = " + map.get( key ).amount );
    }

    static class Value implements Serializable {
        public int amount;
    }
}
```

The IMap lock will automatically be collected by the garbage collector when the map entry is removed.

The IMap lock is reentrant, but it does not support fairness.

Another way to solve the race issue can be acquiring a predictable `Lock` object from Hazelcast. This way, every value in the map can be given a lock or you can create a stripe of locks.


#### Optimistic Locking

The Hazelcast way of optimistic locking is to use the `map.replace` method. See the below sample code. 

```java
public class OptimisticMember {
    public static void main( String[] args ) throws Exception {
        HazelcastInstance hz = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();
        IMap<String, Value> map = hz.getMap( "map" );
        String key = "1";
        map.put( key, new Value() );
        System.out.println( "Starting" );
        for ( int k = 0; k < 1000; k++ ) {
            if ( k % 10 == 0 ) System.out.println( "At: " + k );
            for (; ; ) {
                Value oldValue = map.get( key );
                Value newValue = new Value( oldValue );
                Thread.sleep( 10 );
                newValue.amount++;
                if ( map.replace( key, oldValue, newValue ) )
                    break;
            }
        }
        System.out.println( "Finished! Result = " + map.get( key ).amount );
    }

    static class Value implements Serializable {
        public int amount;

        public Value() {
        }

        public Value( Value that ) {
            this.amount = that.amount;
        }

        public boolean equals( Object o ) {
            if ( o == this ) return true;
            if ( !( o instanceof Value ) ) return false;
            Value that = ( Value ) o;
            return that.amount == this.amount;
        }
    }
}
```

#### Pessimistic vs. Optimistic Locking

Depending on the locking requirements, one locking strategy can be picked.

Optimistic locking is better for mostly read only systems. It has a performance boost over pessimistic locking.

Pessimistic locking is good if there are lots of updates on the same key. It is more robust than optimistic locking from the perspective of data consistency.
In Hazelcast, use `IExecutorService` to submit a task to a key owner, or to a member or members. This is the recommended way to perform task executions that use pessimistic or optimistic locking techniques. `IExecutorService` will have less network hops and less data over wire, and tasks will be executed very near to the data. Please refer to the [Data Affinity section](#data-affinity).

#### ABA Problem

The ABA problem occurs in environments when a shared resource is open to change by multiple threads. Even if one thread sees the same value for a particular key in consecutive reads, it does not mean nothing has changed between the reads. Another thread may come and change the value, do work, and change the value back, but the first thread can think that nothing has changed.

To prevent these kind of problems, one solution is to use a version number and to check it before any write to be sure that nothing has changed between consecutive reads. Although all the other fields will be equal, the version field will prevent objects from being seen as equal. This is the optimistic locking strategy, and it is used in environments which do not expect intensive concurrent changes on a specific key.

In Hazelcast, you can apply optimistic locking strategy with the map `replace` method. This method compares values in object or data forms depending on the in-memory format configuration. If the values are equal, it replaces the old value with the new one. If you want to use your defined `equals` method, in-memory format should be `Object`. Otherwise, Hazelcast serializes objects to binary forms and compares them.
