## Creating Separate Clusters

By specifying group-name and group-password, you can separate your clusters in a simple way; dev group, production group, test group, app-a group etc...

```xml
<hazelcast>
    <group>
        <name>dev</name>
        <password>dev-pass</password>
    </group>
    ...
</hazelcast>
```
You can also set the groupName with `Config` API. JVM can host multiple Hazelcast instances (nodes). Each node can only participate in one group and it only joins to its own group, does not mess with others. Following code creates 3 separate Hazelcast nodes, `h1` belongs to `app1` cluster, while `h2` and `h3` are belong to `app2` cluster.

```java
Config configApp1 = new Config();
configApp1.getGroupConfig().setName("app1");

Config configApp2 = new Config();
configApp2.getGroupConfig().setName("app2");

HazelcastInstance h1 = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(configApp1);
HazelcastInstance h2 = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(configApp2);
HazelcastInstance h3 = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(configApp2);
```
