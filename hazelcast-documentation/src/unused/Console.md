## Console

Management Center has also a console feature that enables you to execute commands on the cluster. For example, you can perform "put"s and "get"s on a map, after you set the namespace with the command `ns <name of your map>`. Same is valid for queues, topics, etc. To execute your command, just type it into the field below the console and press **Enter**. You can type `help` to see all commands that can be used. 

Console window can be opened by clicking on the **Console** button located at the toolbar. A sample view with some commands executed can ben seen below.
