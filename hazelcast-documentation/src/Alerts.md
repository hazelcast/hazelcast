On the next page shown below, specify the frequency of checks in **hour** and **min** fields, give a name for the filter, select whether notification e-mails will be sent (to no one, only admin or to all users) and select whether the alert data will be written to the disk (if checked, you can see the alert log at the directory */users/<your user>/mancenter<version>*).

Alerts can be created when:

-	free memory on the selected nodes is less than the specified number
-	used heap memory is larger than the specified number
-	number of active threads are less than the specified count
-	number of daemon threads are larger than the specified count

When two or more criteria is specified they will be bound with the logical operator **AND**.

On the next page, give a name for the filter, select whether notification e-mails will be sent (to no one, only admin or to all users) and select whether the alert data will be written to the disk (if checked, you can see the alert log at the directory */users/<your user>/mancenter<version>*).

Click on the **Save** button; your filter will be saved and put into the **Filters** part of the page. You can edit the filter by clicking on the ![](images/EditIcon.jpg) icon and delete it by clicking on the ![](images/DeleteIcon.jpg) icon.

**Creating Filters for Data Types**

Select **Data Type Alerts** check box to create filters for data structures. Next screen asks for which data structure (maps, queues, multimaps, executors) the alert will be created. Once a structure is selected, next screen immediately loads and wants you to select the data structure instances (i.e. if you selected *Maps*, it will list all the maps defined in the cluster, you can select only one map or more). Select as desired, click on the **Next** button and select the members on which the selected data structure instances run. 

Next screen, as shown below, is the one where the criteria for the selected data structure are specified.

After the criteria are specified and **Next** button clicked, give a name for the filter, select whether notification e-mails will be sent (to no one, only admin or to all users) and select whether the alert data will be written to the disk (if checked, you can see the alert log at the directory */users/<your user>/mancenter<version>*).

Click on the **Save** button; your filter will be saved and put into the **Filters** part of the page. You can edit the filter by clicking on the ![](images/EditIcon.jpg) icon and delete it by clicking on the ![](images/DeleteIcon.jpg) icon.
