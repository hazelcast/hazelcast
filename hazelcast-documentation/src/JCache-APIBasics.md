### Roundup of Basics

In the [Quick Example section](#quick-example), we have already seen a couple of the base classes and explained how those work. Following are quick descriptions of them.

**`javax.cache.Caching`**:

The access point into the JCache API. It retrieves the general `CachingProvider` backed by any compliant JCache
implementation, such as Hazelcast JCache.

**`javax.cache.spi.CachingProvider`**:

The SPI that is implemented to bridge between the JCache API and the implementation itself. Hazelcast nodes and clients use different
providers chosen as seen in the [Provider Configuration section](#provider-configuration) which enable the JCache API to
interact with Hazelcast clusters.

When a `javax.cache.spi.CachingProvider::getCacheManager` overload is used that takes a `java.lang.ClassLoader` argument, this
classloader will be part of the scope of the created `java.cache.Cache` and it is not possible to retrieve it on other nodes.
We advise not to use those overloads, those are not meant to be used in distributed environments!

**`javax.cache.CacheManager`**:

The `CacheManager` provides the capability to create new and manage existing JCache caches.

provides a type checking of those types at retrieval of the cache. For that reason, all non-types retrieval methods like
`getCache` throw an exception because types cannot be checked.*
<br></br>

**`javax.cache.configuration.Configuration`**, **`javax.cache.configuration.MutableConfiguration`**:

These two classes are used to configure a cache prior to retrieving it from a `CacheManager`. The `Configuration` interface,
therefore, acts as a common super type for all compatible configuration classes such as `MutableConfiguration`.

Hazelcast itself offers a special implementation (`com.hazelcast.config.CacheConfig`) of the `Configuration` interface which
offers more options on the specific Hazelcast properties that can be set to configure features like synchronous and asynchronous
backups counts or selecting the underlying [In Memory Format](#in-memory-format) of the cache. For more information on this
configuration class, please see the reference in [JCache Programmatic Configuration section](#jcache-programmatic-configuration).

**`javax.cache.Cache`**:

This interface represents the cache instance itself. It is comparable to `java.util.Map` but offers special operations dedicated
to the caching use case. Therefore, for example `javax.cache.Cache::put`, unlike `java.util.Map::put`, does not return the old
value previously assigned to the given key.

all given keys in the same bulk operations since no transactional behavior is applied over the whole batch process.*
