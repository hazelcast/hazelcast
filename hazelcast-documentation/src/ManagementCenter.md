## Management Center


### Introduction

Hazelcast Management Center enables you to monitor and manage your nodes running Hazelcast. In addition to monitoring overall state of your clusters, you can also analyze and browse your data structures in detail, update map configurations and take thread dump from nodes. With its scripting and console module, you can run scripts (JavaScript, Groovy, etc.) and commands on your nodes.

#### Installation

You have two options for installing Hazelcast Management Center. You can either deploy the `mancenter`-*version*`.war` application into your Java application server/container or you can start Hazelcast Management Center from the command line and then have the Hazelcast nodes communicate with that web application. This means that your Hazelcast nodes should know the URL of the `mancenter` application before they start.

Here are the steps:

-   Download the latest Hazelcast ZIP from [hazelcast.org](http://www.hazelcast.org/download/). The ZIP contains the `mancenter`-*version*`.war` file. 
-   You can directly start `mancenter`-*version*`.war` file from the command line. The following command will start Hazelcast Management Center on port 8080 with context root 'mancenter' (`http://localhost:8080/mancenter`).

```java
java -jar mancenter-*version*.war 8080 mancenter
```

- Or, you can deploy it to your web server (Tomcat, Jetty, etc.). Let us say it is running at `http://localhost:8080/mancenter`.
- After you perform the above steps, make sure that `http://localhost:8080/mancenter` is up.
- Configure your Hazelcast nodes by adding the URL of your web application to your `hazelcast.xml`. Hazelcast nodes will send their states to this URL.


```xml
<management-center enabled="true">http://localhost:8080/mancenter</management-center>
```

-   Start your Hazelcast cluster.

-   Browse to `http://localhost:8080/mancenter` and login. **Initial login username/password is `admin/admin`**

The Management Center creates a folder with the name "mancenter" under your "user/home" folder to save data files. You can change the data folder by setting the `hazelcast.mancenter.home` system property.



### Tool Overview

Once the page is loaded after selecting a cluster, the tool's home page appears as shown below.

### Home Page
This is the first page appearing after logging in. It gives an overview of the connected cluster. The following subsections describe each portion of the page.


#### CPU Utilization
This part of the page provides load and utilization information for the CPUs for each node, as shown below.

![](images/NonHMCCPUUtil.jpg)

The first column lists the nodes with their IPs and ports. The next columns list the loads on each CPU for the last 1, 5 and 15 minutes. The last column (**Chart**) graphically shows the utilization of CPUs. When you move the mouse cursor on a desired graph, you can see the CPU utilization at the time where the cursor is placed. Graphs under this column shows the CPU utilizations approximately for the last 2 minutes.


#### Memory Utilization
This part of the page provides information related to memory usages for each node, as shown below.

![](images/NonHMCMemoryUtil.jpg)

The first column lists the nodes with their IPs and ports. The next columns show the used and free memories out of the total memory reserved for Hazelcast usage, in real-time. The **Max** column lists the maximum memory capacity of each node and the **Percent** column lists the percentage value of used memory out of the maximum memory. The last column (**Chart**) shows the memory usage of nodes graphically. When you move the mouse cursor on a desired graph, you can see the memory usage at the time where the cursor is placed. Graphs under this column shows the memory usages approximately for the last 2 minutes.

#### Memory Distribution
This part of the page graphically provides the cluster wise breakdown of memory, as shown below. The blue area is the memory used by maps, the dark yellow area is the memory used by non-Hazelcast entities, and the green area is the free memory out of the whole cluster`s memory capacity.

![](images/Home-MemoryDistribution.jpg)

In the above example, you can see 0.32% of the total memory is used by Hazelcast maps (it can be seen by placing the mouse cursor on it), 58.75% is used by non-Hazelcast entities and 40.85% of the total memory is free.

#### Map Memory Distribution
This part is the breakdown of the blue area shown in the **Memory Distribution** graph explained above. It provides the percentage values of the memories used by each map, out of the total cluster memory reserved for all Hazelcast maps.

![](images/Home-MapMemoryDistribution.jpg)

In the above example, you can see 49.55% of the total map memory is used by **map1** and 49.55% is used by **map2**.

#### Partition Distribution
This pie chart shows what percentage of partitions each node has, as shown below.

![](images/Home-PartitionDistribution.jpg)

You can see each node's partition percentages by placing the mouse cursor on the chart. In the above example, you can see the node "127.0.0.1:5708" has 5.64% of the total partition count (which is 271 by default and configurable, please see the `hazelcast.partition.count` property explained in the [Advanced Configuration Properties section](#advanced-configuration-properties)).

-	**Thread Dump**: When pressed, thread dump of the selected member is taken and shown as a separate dialog to the user.
-	**Shutdown Node**: It is used to shutdown the selected member.




### Scripting


You can use the scripting feature of this tool to execute codes on the cluster. To open this feature as a tab, select **Scripting** located at the toolbar on top. Once selected, the scripting feature opens as shown below.

![](images/scripting.jpg)

In this window, the **Scripting** part is the actual coding editor. You can select the members on which the code will execute from the **Members** list shown at the right side of the window. Below the members list, a combo box enables you to select a scripting language: currently, Javascript, Ruby, Groovy and Python languages are supported. After you write your script and press the **Execute** button, you can see the execution result in the **Result** part of the window.

There are **Save** and **Delete** buttons on the top right of the scripting editor. To save your scripts, press the **Save** button after you type a name for your script into the field next to this button. The scripts you saved are listed in the **Saved Scripts** part of the window, located at the bottom right of the page. Click on a saved script from this list to execute or edit it. If you want to remove a script that you wrote and saved before, select it from this list and press the **Delete** button.

In the scripting engine you have a `HazelcastInstance` bonded to a variable named `hazelcast`. You can invoke any method that `HazelcastInstance` has via the `hazelcast` variable. You can see example usage for JavaScript below.


```javascript
var name = hazelcast.getName();
var node = hazelcast.getCluster().getLocalMember();
var employees = hazelcast.getMap("employees");
employees.put("1","John Doe");
employees.get("1"); // will return "John Doe"
```


### Console

The Management Center has a console feature that enables you to execute commands on the cluster. For example, you can perform `put`s and `get`s on a map, after you set the namespace with the command `ns <name of your map>`. The same is valid for queues, topics, etc. To execute your command, type it into the field below the console and press **Enter**. Type `help` to see all the commands that you can use.

Open a console window by clicking on the **Console** button located on the toolbar. Below is a sample view with some executed commands.

![](images/console.jpg)



### Alerts

You can use the alerts feature of this tool to receive alerts by creating filters. In these filters, you can specify criteria for cluster, nodes or data structures. When the specified criteria are met for a filter, the related alert is shown as a pop-up message on the top right of the page.

Once you click the **Alerts** button located on the toolbar, the page shown below appears.

![](images/admin.jpg)

To add a user to the system, specify the username, e-mail and password in the **Add/Edit User** part of the page. If the user to be added will have administrator privileges, select **isAdmin** checkbox. **Permissions** checkboxes have two values:

-	**Read Only**: If this permission is given to the user, only *Home*, *Documentation* and *Time Travel* items will be visible at the toolbar at that user's session. Also, users with this permission cannot update a [map configuration](#map-config), run a garbage collection and take a thread dump on a node, or shutdown a node (please see the [Members](#members) section).
-	**Read/Write**: If this permission is given to the user, *Home*, *Scripting*, *Console*, *Documentation* and *Time Travel* items will be visible. The users with this permission can update a map configuration and perform operations on the nodes.

After you enter/select all fields, click **Save** button to create the user. You will see the newly created user's username on the left side, in the **Users** part of the page.


To edit or delete a user, select a username listed in the **Users**. Selected user information appears on the right side of the page. To update the user information, change the fields as desired and click the **Save** button. To delete the user from the system, click the **Delete** button.



### Time Travel

Time Travel is used to check the status of the cluster at a time in the past. When this item is selected on the toolbar, a small window appears on top of the page, as shown below.

![](images/timetravel.jpg)

To see the cluster status in a past time, Time Travel should be enabled first. Click on the area where it says **OFF** (on the right of Time Travel window). It will turn to **ON** after it asks whether to enable the Time Travel with a dialog: click on **Enable** in the dialog to enable Time Travel.

Once it is **ON**, the status of your cluster will be stored on your disk as long as your web server is alive.

You can go back in time using the slider and/or calendar and check your cluster's situation at the selected time. All data structures and members can be monitored as if you are using the management center normally (charts and data tables for each data structure and members). Using the arrow buttons placed at both sides of the slider, you can go back or further with steps of 5 seconds. It will show status if Time Travel has been **ON** at the selected time in past; otherwise, all the charts and tables will be shown as empty.

The historical data collected with Time Travel feature are stored in a file database on the disk. These files can be found on the folder specified by `hazelcast.mancenter.home` (by default `mancenter3` folder in the user home folder).

### Documentation

To see the documentation, click on the **Documentation** button located at the toolbar. Management Center manual will appear as a tab.
