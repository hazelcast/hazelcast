## Management Center


### Introduction

Hazelcast Management Center enables you to monitor and manage your nodes running Hazelcast. In addition to monitoring overall state of your clusters, you can also analyze and browse your data structures in detail, update map configurations and take thread dump from nodes. With its scripting and console module, you can run scripts (JavaScript, Groovy, etc.) and commands on your nodes.

#### Installation

There are two options for installing Hazelcast Management Center. You can either deploy `mancenter`-*version*`.war` application into your Java application server/container or start Hazelcast Management Center directly from the command line and then have the Hazelcast nodes communicate with that web application. That means, your Hazelcast nodes should know the URL of `mancenter` application before they start.

Here are the steps:

-   Download the latest Hazelcast ZIP from [hazelcast.org](http://www.hazelcast.org/download/). ZIP contains `mancenter`-*version*`.war` file. 
-   You can directly start `mancenter`-*version*`.war` file from the command line:

```java
java -jar mancenter-*version*.war 8080 mancenter
```

- The above command will start Hazelcast Management Center on port 8080 with context root 'mancenter' (`http://localhost:8080/mancenter`).
- Or, you can deploy it to your web server (Tomcat, Jetty, etc.). Let us say it is running at `http://localhost:8080/mancenter`.
- After above steps are performed, make sure that `http://localhost:8080/mancenter` is up.
- Configure your Hazelcast nodes by adding the URL of your web application to your `hazelcast.xml`. Hazelcast nodes will send their states to this URL.


```xml
<management-center enabled="true">http://localhost:8080/mancenter</management-center>
```

-   Start your Hazelcast cluster.

-   Browse to `http://localhost:8080/mancenter` and login. **Initial login username/password is `admin/admin`**

Management Center creates a directory with name "mancenter" under your "user/home" directory to save data files. You can change the data directory by setting `hazelcast.mancenter.home` system property.



### Tool Overview

Once the page is loaded after selecting a cluster, tool's home page appears as shown below.

### Home Page
This is the first page appearing after logging in. It gives an overview of the cluster connected. Below subsections describe each portion of the page.


#### CPU Utilization
This part of the page provides information related to load and utilization of CPUs for each node, as shown below.

![](images/NonHMCCPUUtil.jpg)

First column lists the nodes with their IPs and ports. Then, the loads on each CPU for the last 1, 5 and 15 minutes are listed. The last column (**Chart**) shows the utilization of CPUs graphically. When you move the mouse cursor on a desired graph, you can see the CPU utilization at the time to which cursor corresponds. Graphs under this column shows the CPU utilizations approximately for the last 2 minutes.


#### Memory Utilization
This part of the page provides information related to memory usages for each node, as shown below.

![](images/NonHMCMemoryUtil.jpg)

First column lists the nodes with their IPs and ports. Then, used and free memories out of the total memory reserved for Hazelcast usage are shown, in real-time. **Max** column lists the maximum memory capacity of each node and **Percent** column lists the percentage value of used memory out of the maximum memory. The last column (**Chart**) shows the memory usage of nodes graphically. When you move the mouse cursor on a desired graph, you can see the memory usage at the time to which cursor corresponds. Graphs under this column shows the memory usages approximately for the last 2 minutes.

#### Memory Distribution
This part of the page graphically provides the cluster wise breakdown of memory, as shown below. Blue area is the memory used by maps, dark yellow area is the memory used by non-Hazelcast entities and green area is the free memory (out of whole cluster`s memory capacity).

![](images/Home-MemoryDistribution.jpg)

In the above example, you can see 0.32% of the total memory is used by Hazelcast maps (it can be seen by moving the mouse cursor on it), 58.75% is used by non-Hazelcast entities and 40.85% of the total memory is free.

#### Map Memory Distribution
This part is actually the breakdown of the blue area shown in **Memory Distribution** graph explained above. It provides the percentage values of the memories used by each map, out of the total cluster memory reserved for all Hazelcast maps.

![](images/Home-MapMemoryDistribution.jpg)

In the above example, you can see 49.55% of the total map memory is used by **map1** and 49.55% is used by **map2**.

#### Partition Distribution
This pie chart shows what percentage of partitions each node has, as shown below.

![](images/Home-PartitionDistribution.jpg)

You can see each node's partition percentages by moving the mouse cursor on the chart. In the above example, you can see the node "127.0.0.1:5708" has 5.64% of the total partition count (which is 271 by default and configurable, please see [Advanced Configuration Properties](http://hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/hazelcast-documentation.html#advanced-configuration-properties)).

-	**Thread Dump**: When pressed, thread dump of the selected member is taken and shown as a separate dialog to the user.
-	**Shutdown Node**: It is used to shutdown the selected member.




### Scripting


Scripting feature of this tool is used to execute codes on the cluster. You can open this feature as a tab by selecting **Scripting** located at the toolbar on top. Once selected, it is opened as shown below.

![](images/scripting.jpg)

In this window, **Scripting** part is the actual coding editor. You can select the members on which the code will be executed from the **Members** list shown at the right side of the window. Below the members list there is a combo box enabling you to select a scripting language. Currently, Javascript, Ruby, Groovy and Python languages are supported. After you write your script and press **Execute** button, you can see the execution result in the **Result** part of the window.

There are also **Save** and **Delete** buttons on top right of the scripting editor. You can save your scripts by pressing the **Save** button after you type a name for the script into the field next to this button. The scripts you saved are listed in the **Saved Scripts** part of the window, located at the bottom right of the page. You can simply click on a saved script from this list to execute or edit it. And, if you want to remove a script that you wrote and save before, just select it from this list and press **Delete** button.

In the scripting engine you have a `HazelcastInstance` bonded to a variable named `hazelcast`. You can invoke any method that `HazelcastInstance` has via the `hazelcast` variable. You can see sample usage for JavaScript below.


```javascript
var name = hazelcast.getName();
var node = hazelcast.getCluster().getLocalMember();
var employees = hazelcast.getMap("employees");
employees.put("1","John Doe");
employees.get("1"); // will return "John Doe"
```


### Console

Management Center has also a console feature that enables you to execute commands on the cluster. For example, you can perform "put"s and "get"s on a map, after you set the namespace with the command `ns <name of your map>`. Same is valid for queues, topics, etc. To execute your command, just type it into the field below the console and press **Enter**. You can type `help` to see all commands that can be used.

Console window can be opened by clicking on the **Console** button located at the toolbar. A sample view with some commands executed can ben seen below.

Alerts can be created when:

-	free memory on the selected nodes is less than the specified number
-	used heap memory is larger than the specified number
-	number of active threads are less than the specified count
-	number of daemon threads are larger than the specified count

When two or more criteria is specified they will be bound with the logical operator **AND**.

On the next page, give a name for the filter, select whether notification e-mails will be sent (to no one, only admin or to all users) and select whether the alert data will be written to the disk (if checked, you can see the alert log at the directory */users/<your user>/mancenter<version>*).

Click on the **Save** button; your filter will be saved and put into the **Filters** part of the page. You can edit the filter by clicking on the ![](images/EditIcon.jpg) icon and delete it by clicking on the ![](images/DeleteIcon.jpg) icon.

**Creating Filters for Data Types**

Select **Data Type Alerts** check box to create filters for data structures. Next screen asks for which data structure (maps, queues, multimaps, executors) the alert will be created. Once a structure is selected, next screen immediately loads and wants you to select the data structure instances (i.e. if you selected *Maps*, it will list all the maps defined in the cluster, you can select only one map or more). Select as desired, click on the **Next** button and select the members on which the selected data structure instances run.

Next screen, as shown below, is the one where the criteria for the selected data structure are specified.

![](images/DataAlert1.jpg)

As it can be seen, you will select an item from the left combo box, select the operator in the middle one, specify a value in the input field and click on the **Add** button. You can create more than one criteria in this page, and those will be bound by the logical operator **AND**.

After the criteria are specified and **Next** button clicked, give a name for the filter, select whether notification e-mails will be sent (to no one, only admin or to all users) and select whether the alert data will be written to the disk (if checked, you can see the alert log at the directory */users/<your user>/mancenter<version>*).

Click on the **Save** button; your filter will be saved and put into the **Filters** part of the page. You can edit the filter by clicking on the ![](images/EditIcon.jpg) icon and delete it by clicking on the ![](images/DeleteIcon.jpg) icon.

![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *This toolbar item is available only to admin users, i.e. the users who initially have ***admin*** as their both usernames and passwords.*

**Admin** user can add, edit, remove users and specify the permissions for the users of Management Center. To perform these operations, click on **Administration** button located at the toolbar. The page shown below appears.

![](images/admin.jpg)

To add a user to the system, specify the username, e-mail and password in the **Add/Edit User** part of the page. If the user to be added will have administrator privileges, select **isAdmin** checkbox. **Permissions** checkboxes have two values:

-	**Read Only**: If this permission is given to the user, only *Home*, *Documentation* and *Time Travel* items will be visible at the toolbar at that user's session. Also, the users with this permission cannot update a [map configuration](#map-config), run a garbage collection and take a thread dump on a node, and shutdown a node (please see [Members](#members) section).
-	**Read/Write**: If this permission is given to the user, *Home*, *Scripting*, *Console*, *Documentation* and *Time Travel* items will be visible. The users with this permission can update a map configuration and perform operations on the nodes.

After all fields are entered/selected, click **Save** button to create the user. You will see the newly created user's username on the left side, in the **Users** part of the page.


To edit or delete a user, select a username listed in the **Users**. Selected user's information will appear on the right side of the page. To update the user information, change the fields as desired and click **Save** button. To delete the user from the system, click **Delete** button.



### Time Travel

Time Travel is used to check the status of the cluster at a time in the past. Once this item is selected on the toolbar, a small window appears on top of the page, as shown below.

![](images/timetravel.jpg)

To see the cluster status in a past time, Time Travel should be enabled first. Click on the area where it says **OFF** (on the right of Time Travel window). It will turn to **ON** after it asks whether to enable the Time Travel with a dialog (just click on **Enable**).

Once it is **ON**, it means that the status of your cluster is started to be stored on your disk, as long as your web server is alive.

You can go back in time using the slider and/or calendar and check your cluster's situation at the selected time. All data structures and members can be monitored as if you are using the management center normally (charts and data tables for each data structure and members). Using the arrow buttons placed at both sides of the slider, you can go back or further with steps of 5 seconds. Naturally, it will show the status if Time Travel has been **ON** at the selected time in past. Otherwise, all charts and tables will be shown as empty.

The historical data collected with Time Travel feature are stored in a file database on the disk. These files can be found on the directory specified by `hazelcast.mancenter.home` (by default `mancenter3` directory in user home folder.)

### Documentation

To see the documentation, click on the **Documentation** button located at the toolbar. Management Center manual will appear as a tab.
