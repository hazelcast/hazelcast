## Introduction

Hazelcast Hosted Management Center enables you to monitor and manage your nodes running Hazelcast. In addition to monitoring overall state of your clusters, you can also analyze and browse your data structures in detail, update map configurations and take thread dump from nodes. With its scripting and console module, you can run scripts (JavaScript, Groovy etc.) and commands on your nodes. It is a web based tool and you can deploy it into your internal server and serve your users.

---

## Installation

Basically, `mancenter`-*version*`.war` application should be deployed into the Java web server and  Hazelcast nodes should be configured to communicate with this application, i.e. Hazelcast nodes should know the URL of `mancenter` application before they are started.

Here are the steps:

-   Download the latest Hazelcast zip from [hazelcast.org](http://www.hazelcast.org/download/).

-   Zip contains `mancenter`-*version*`.war` file. Deploy it to your web server (Tomcat, Jetty etc.) Let's say it is running at`http://localhost:8080/mancenter-`*version*

-   Start your web server and make sure `http://localhost:8080/mancenter`-*version*` is up.

-   Configure your Hazelcast nodes by adding the URL of your web app to your `hazelcast.xml`. Hazelcast nodes will send their states to this URL.

```xml
<management-center enabled="true">http://localhost:8080/mancenter-version</management-center>
```
-   Start your Hazelcast cluster.

*Management Center creates a directory with name "mancenter" under your "user/home" directory to save data files. You can change the data directory setting "hazelcast.mancenter.home" system property.*

---

## Login & Sign Up
After the cluster has started, go to `http://localhost:8080/mancenter`-*version* using any web browser. Below page will load.

-	**Home**: When pressed, loads the home page shown above. Please see [Home Page](#homepage).
-	**Scripting**: When pressed, loads the page used to write and execute user`s own scripts on the cluster. Please see [Scripting](#scripting).
-	**Console**: When pressed, loads the page used to execute commands on the cluster. Please see [Console](#console).
-	**Documentation**: It is used to open the documentation of Hosted Management Center in a window inside the tool. Please see [Documentation](#documentation).
-	**Cluster Selector**: It is used to switch between clusters. When the mouse is moved onto this item, a dropdown list of clusters appears.

     ![](images/4ChangeCluster.jpg)
     
     The user can select any cluster and once selected, the page immediately loads with the selected cluster's information.
-	**Logout**: It is used to close the current user's session.

####Menu
Home page includes a menu on the left which lists the distributed data structures in the cluster and also all cluster members (nodes), as shown below.

![](images/LeftMenu.jpg)

Menu items can be expanded/collapsed by clicking on them. Below is the list of menu items with the links to their explanations.
     
-	[Maps](#maps)
-	[Queues](#queues)
-	[Topics](#topics)
-	[MultiMaps](#MultiMaps)
-	[Executors](#executors)
-	[Members](#members)

####Tabbed View
Each time an item from the toolbar or menu is selected, it is added to main view as a tab, as shown below.

![](images/TabbedView.jpg)

In the above example, *Home*, *Scripting*, *Console*, *queue1* and *map1* windows can be seen as tabs. Windows can be closed using the ![](images/CloseIcon.jpg) icon on each tab (except the Home Page; it cannot be closed).

---


##Home Page
This is the first page appearing after logging in. It gives an overview of the cluster connected. Below subsections describe each portion of the page.

####Cluster Info
On top of the page, **Cluster Info** is placed, as shown below.

![](images/HomeClusterInfo.jpg)

-	**Version**: Shows the release number of Hazelcast used.
-	**Start Time**: It is the date and time (UTC) when first node of the connected cluster was started.
-	**Up Time**: Shows the period of time in days, hours, minutes and seconds for which connected Hazelcast cluster is up.
-	**Used Memory**: Shows the real-time total memory used in the whole cluster.
-	**Free Memory**: Shows the real-time memory that is free in the whole cluster.
-	**Max Memory**: Shows the maximum memory that the whole cluster has.

####CPU Load Averages & Utilization
This part of the page provides information related to load and utilization of CPUs for each node, as shown below.

![](images/Home-CPULoadAveragesUtilization.jpg)

First column lists the nodes with their IPs and ports. Then, the loads on each CPU for the last 1, 5 and 15 minutes are listed. The last column (**Utilization(%)**) shows the utilization of CPUs graphically. When you move the mouse cursor on a desired graph, you can see the CPU utilization at the time to which cursor corresponds. In the above example, the CPU utilization at 10:53:25 (where the mouse cursor is on) is -1%. Graphs under this column shows the CPU utilizations approximately for the last 2 minutes.


####Memory Usages
This part of the page provides information related to memory usages for each node, as shown below.

![](images/Home-MemoryUsages.jpg)

First column lists the nodes with their IPs and ports. Then, used and free memories out of the total memory reserved for Hazelcast usage are shown, in real-time. **Max** column lists the maximum memory capacity of each node and **Percent** column lists the percentage value of used memory out of the maximum memory. The last column (**Used Memory(%)**) shows the memory usage of nodes graphically. When you move the mouse cursor on a desired graph, you can see the memory usage at the time to which cursor corresponds. In the above example, the memory usage at 10:53:55 (where the mouse cursor is on) is 32 MB. Graphs under this column shows the memory usages approximately for the last 2 minutes.

####Memory Distribution
This part of the page graphically provides the cluster wise breakdown of memory, as shown below. Blue area is the memory used by maps, dark yellow area is the memory used by non-Hazelcast entities and green area is the free memory (out of whole cluster`s memory capacity).

![](images/Home-MemoryDistribution.jpg)

In the above example, you can see 0.32% of the total memory is used by Hazelcast maps (it can be seen by moving the mouse cursor on it), 58.75% is used by non-Hazelcast entities and 40.85% of the total memory is free.

####Map Memory Distribution
This part is actually the breakdown of the blue area shown in **Memory Distribution** graph explained above. It provides the percentage values of the memories used by each map, out of the total cluster memory reserved for all Hazelcast maps.

![](images/Home-MapMemoryDistribution.jpg)

In the above example, you can see 49.55% of the total map memory is used by **map1** and 49.55% is used by **map2**.

####Health Check
This part is useful to check how the cluster in general behaves. It lists the nodes (cluster members), locks and partition mismatches along with the information related to migrations and node interconnections. To see these, just click on the **Check Cluster Health** button. A sample is shown below.

![](images/Home-HealthCheckbuttonpressed.jpg)

You can see each node's IP address and port by clicking on the plus sign at the **Members**.

####Partition Distribution
This pie chart shows what percentage of partitions each node has, as shown below.

![](images/Home-PartitionDistribution.jpg)

You can see each node's partition percentages by moving the mouse cursor on the chart. In the above example, you can see the node "127.0.0.1:5708" has 5.64% of the total partition count (which is 271 by default and configurable, please see [Advanced Configuration Properties](http://hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/hazelcast-documentation.html#advanced-configuration-properties)).

####System Warnings
This part of the page shows informative warnings in situations like shutting down a node, as shown below.

![](images/SystemWarnings.jpg)

Warnings can be cleared by clicking on the **Clear** link placed at top right of the window.

## Maps

Map instances are listed under the **Maps** menu item on the left. When you click on a map, a new tab for monitoring that map instance is opened on the right, as shown below. In this tab, you can monitor metrics and also re-configure the selected map.

![](images/MapsHome.jpg)

Below subsections explain the portions of this window.


### Monitoring Maps

In map page you can monitor instance metrics by 2 charts and 2 datatables. First data table "Memory Data Table" gives the memory metrics distributed over members. "Throughput Data Table" gives information about the operations performed on instance (get, put, remove) Each chart monitors a type data of the instance on cluster. You can change the type by clicking on chart. The possible ones are: Size, Throughput, Memory, Backup Size, Backup Memory, Hits, Locked Entries, Puts, Gets, Removes...

## Console

The console tool enables you execute commands on the cluster. You can read or write on instances but first you should set namespace. For example if you have a map with name "mapCustomers". To get a customer with key "Jack" you should first set the namespace with command "ns mapCustomers". Then you can take the object by "m.get Jack" Here is the command list:

```
-- General commands
echo true|false                      //turns on/off echo of commands (default false)
silent true|false                    //turns on/off silent of command output (default false)
<number> <command>                  //repeats <number> time <command>, replace $i in <command> with current iteration (0..<number-1>)
&<number> <command>                  //forks <number> threads to execute <command>, replace $t in <command> with current thread number (0..<number-1>
     When using #x or &x, is is advised to use silent true as well.
     When using &x with m.putmany and m.removemany, each thread will get a different share of keys unless a start key index is specified
jvm                                  //displays info about the runtime
who                                  //displays info about the cluster

## Time Travel

Time Travel mode is activated by clicking clock icon on top right toolbar. In time travel mode, the time is paused and the full state of the cluster is displayed according the time selected on time slider. You can change time either by Prev/Next buttons or sliding the slider. Also you can change the day by clicking calendar icon. Management center stores the states in you local disk, while your web server is alive. So if you slide to a time when you do not have data, the reports will be seen as empty.
