    Say you have more than one web servers (A, B, C) with a load balancer in front of them. If server A goes down
    then your users on that server will be directed to one of the live servers (B or C) but their sessions will be lost!
    So we have to have all these sessions backed up somewhere if we don't want to lose the sessions upon server crashes.
    Hazelcast WM allows you to cluster user http sessions automatically. The following are required for enabling
    Hazelcast Session Clustering:
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para>Target application or web server should support Java 1.5+
            </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Target application or web server should support Servlet 2.4+ spec
            </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Session objects that needs to be clustered have to be Serializable
            </para>
        </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    Here are the steps to setup Hazelcast Session Clustering:
    <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para>Put the
                <literal>hazelcast</literal>

                jars in your
                <literal>WEB-INF/lib</literal>
                directory. Optionally if you wish to connect to a cluster as a client add
                <literal>hazelcast-client</literal>
                as well.
            </para>

            <para>Put the following xml into
                <literal>web.xml</literal>
                file. Make sure Hazelcast filter is placed

        Hazelcast holds whole session attributes in a distributed map and in local http session. Local session is required

                    because now they have dirty value. So when a request arrives one of those other nodes
                    that attribute value is fetched from clustered cache.</emphasis>

                        If Hazelcast knows sessions are sticky, invalidation will not be send, because Hazelcast assumes there is
                        no other local session at the moment. When a server is down, requests belonging to a session hold
                        in that server will routed to other one and that server will fetch session data from clustered cache.
                        That means using sticky-sessions, one will not suffer performance penalty of accessing clustered data
                        and can benefit recover from a server failure.</emphasis>
