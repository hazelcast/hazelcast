    Say you have more than one web servers (A, B, C) with a load balancer in front of them. If server A goes down
    then your users on that server will be directed to one of the live servers (B or C) but their sessions will be lost!
    So we have to have all these sessions backed up somewhere if we don't want to lose the sessions upon server crashes.
    Hazelcast WM allows you to cluster user http sessions automatically. Followings are required for enabling
    Hazelcast Session Clustering:
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para>Target application or web server should support Java 1.5+
            </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Target application or web server should support Servlet 2.4+ spec
            </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Session objects that needs to be clustered have to be Serializable
            </para>
        </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    Here are the steps to setup Hazelcast Session Clustering:

                jars in your

        How is your load-balancer configured?
        stick-session means all requests of a session
        is routed to the node where the session is first created.
        This is excellent for performance.
        If sticky-session is set to false, when a session is updated
        on a node, entry for this session on all other nodes is invalidated.
        You have to know how your load-balancer is configured before

    It is that easy! All http requests will go through Hazelcast
    <literal>WebFilter</literal>
    and it will put the
    session objects into Hazelcast distributed map if needed.
