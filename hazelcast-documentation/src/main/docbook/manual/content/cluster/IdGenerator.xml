    <title>Cluster-wide Id Generator</title>
    <para>
        Hazelcast IdGenerator creates cluster-wide unique IDs. Generated IDs are long type primitive values between 0
        and
        <literal>Long.MAX_VALUE</literal>
        . Id generation occurs almost at the speed of
        <literal>AtomicLong.incrementAndGet()</literal>
        . Generated IDs are unique during the life cycle of the cluster. If the entire cluster is restarted, IDs start
        from 0 again.
