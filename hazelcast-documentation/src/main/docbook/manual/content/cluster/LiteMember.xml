    <para>
        LiteMembers are members with no storage. If
        <literal>-Dhazelcast.lite.member=true</literal>
        JVM parameter is set, then the JVM will join the cluster as a 'lite member' which will not be a 'data
        partition' (no data on that node) but will have super fast access to the cluster
        just like any regular member does.
