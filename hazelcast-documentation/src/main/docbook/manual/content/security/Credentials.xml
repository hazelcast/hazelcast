    <title>Credentials</title>
    <para>One of the key elements in Hazelcast security is
        <literal>Credentials</literal>
        object. It
        is used to carry all credentials of an endpoint (member or client).
        <literal>Credentials</literal>
        is an interface which extends
        <code>Serializable</code>
        and has three methods to be implemented. Users,
        according to their needs, can either implement
        <literal>Credentials</literal>
        interface or
        extend
        <literal>AbstractCredentials</literal>
        class which is an abstract implementation of
        <literal>Credentials</literal>.
        <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[
package com.hazelcast.security;
...
public interface Credentials extends Serializable {

    String getEndpoint();

    void setEndpoint(String endpoint) ;
    
    String getPrincipal() ;    
}
]]></programlisting>
        <code>Credentials.setEndpoint()</code>
        method is called by Hazelcast when auth request arrives to node
        before authentication takes place.
        <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[
package com.hazelcast.security;
...
public abstract class AbstractCredentials implements Credentials, DataSerializable {
    private transient String endpoint;
    private String principal;

    ...
}
]]></programlisting>
        <literal>UsernamePasswordCredentials</literal>, a custom implementation of
        <literal>Credentials</literal>
        can be found in Hazelcast
        <code>com.hazelcast.security</code>
        package. It is used by default configuration during
        authentication process of both members and clients.
        <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[
package com.hazelcast.security;
...
public class UsernamePasswordCredentials extends Credentials {
    private byte[] password;
    ...
