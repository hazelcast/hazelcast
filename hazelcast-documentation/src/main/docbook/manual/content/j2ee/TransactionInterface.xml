    <para>
        Hazelcast can be used in transactional context. Basically create a <literal>TransactionContext</literal>
        which can be used to begin, commit, rollback transaction.
        Obtain transaction aware instances of queues, maps, sets, lists, multimaps via <literal>TransactionContext</literal>,
        work with them and commit/rollback in one shot.

        <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[import java.util.Queue;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.Set;
import com.hazelcast.core.Hazelcast;
import com.hazelcast.core.Transaction; 

Config cfg = new Config();
HazelcastInstance hz = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(cfg);

TransactionContext context = hz.newTransactionContext()
context.beginTransaction();

TransactionalQueue queue = context.getQueue("myqueue");
TransactionalMap map     = context.getMap  ("mymap");
TransactionalSet set     = context.getSet  ("myset");

try {
    Object obj = queue.poll();
    //process obj
    map.put ("1", "value1");
    set.add ("value");
    //do other things..
    context.commitTransaction();
}catch (Throwable t)  {
    context.rollbackTransaction();
}
]]></programlisting>

        Isolation is always
        <literal>REPEATABLE_READ</literal>
        . If you are in a transaction, you can read the data in your transaction and the data that is already committed
        and if not in a transaction, you can only read the committed data. Implementation is different for queue and
        map/set. For queue operations (offer,poll), offered and/or polled objects are copied to the next member in order
        to safely commit/rollback. For map/set, Hazelcast first acquires the locks for the write operations (put,
        remove) and holds the differences (what is added/removed/updated) locally for each transaction. When transaction
        is set to commit, Hazelcast will release the locks and apply the differences. When rolling back, Hazelcast will
        simply releases the locks and discard the differences.
