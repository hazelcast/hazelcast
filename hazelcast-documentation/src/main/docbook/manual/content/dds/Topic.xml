    <title>Distributed Topic</title>
    <para>Hazelcast provides distribution mechanism for publishing messages that are delivered to
        multiple subscribers which is also known as publish/subscribe (pub/sub) messaging model.
        Publish and subscriptions are cluster-wide. When a member subscribes for a topic, it is
        actually registering for messages published by any member in the cluster, including the new
        members joined after you added the listener. Messages are ordered, meaning,
        listeners(subscribers) will process the messages in the order they are actually published.
        If cluster member M publishes messages m1, m2, m3...mn to a topic T, then Hazelcast makes
        sure that all of the subscribers of topic T will receive and process m1, m2, m3...mn in
        order. Therefore there is only single thread invoking onMessage. The user shouldn't keep the
        thread busy and preferably dispatch it via an Executor. This will increase the performance
        of the topic
