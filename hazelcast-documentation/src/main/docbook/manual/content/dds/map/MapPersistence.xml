    <para>Hazelcast allows you to load and store the distributed map entries from/to a
        persistent datastore such as relational database. If a loader implementation is
        provided, when
        <literal>get(key)</literal>
        is called, if the map entry doesn't exist
        in-memory then Hazelcast will call your loader implementation to load the entry from a
        datastore. If a store implementation is provided, when
        <literal>put(key,value)</literal>
        is called, Hazelcast will call your store implementation to store the entry into a
        datastore. Hazelcast can call your implementation to store the entries synchronously
        (write-through) with no-delay or asynchronously (write-behind) with delay and it is
        defined by the
        <literal>write-delay-seconds</literal>
        value in the configuration.
    </para>
    <para>If it is write-through, when the
        <literal>map.put(key,value)</literal>
        call returns,

        If it is write-behind, when the

        call returns, you can be sure that

                <para>The entry is marked as
                    <literal>dirty</literal>
                    so that after
                    <literal>write-delay-seconds</literal>, it can be persisted.
                </para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        Same behavior goes for the
        <literal>remove(key</literal>
        and
        <literal>MapStore.delete(key)</literal>. If
        <literal>MapStore</literal>
        throws an
        exception then the exception will be propagated back to the original
        <literal>put</literal>
        or
        <literal>remove</literal>
        call in the form of
        <literal>RuntimeException</literal>. When write-through is used, Hazelcast will call
        <literal>MapStore.store(key,value)</literal>
        and
        <literal>MapStore.delete(key)</literal>
        for each entry update. When write-behind is
        used, Hazelcast will call<literal>MapStore.store(map)</literal>, and
        <literal>MapStore.delete(collection)</literal>
        to do all writes in a single call.
        Also note that your MapStore or MapLoader implementation should not use Hazelcast
        Map/Queue/MultiMap/List/Set operations. Your implementation should only work with your
        data store. Otherwise you may get into deadlock situations.

               will be called as soon as the entry is updated.
               Otherwise it is write-behind so updates will be stored after write-delay-seconds

        API is used for pre-populating the

        returns NULL then nothing will be loaded.
        Your
        <literal>MapLoader.loadAllKeys</literal>
        implementation can return all or some of the keys. You may
        select and return only the
        <literal>hot</literal>
        keys, for instance. Also note that
        this is the fastest way of pre-populating the map as Hazelcast will optimize the loading
        process by having each node loading owned portion of the entries.

    <para>
        In some scenarios, you may need to modify the object after storing it into the map store.
        For example you can get id or version auto generated by your database and you need to modify your object stored in distributed map,
        not to break the sync between database and data grid. You can do that by implementing PostProcessingMapStore interface;
        so the modified object will put to the distributed map. That will cause an extra step of Serialization, so use it just when needed.
        (this explanation is only valid when using <literal>write-through</literal> map store configuration)

        Here an example of post processing map store:

            public void store(Integer key, Employee employee) {
                EmployeeId id = saveEmployee();
                employee.setId(id.getId());
            }
