    <title>Near Cache</title>
    <para>Map entries in Hazelcast are partitioned across the cluster. Imagine that you are
        reading key
        <literal>k</literal>
        so many times and
        <literal>k</literal>
        is owned by another member in your cluster. Each
        <literal>map.get(k)</literal>
        will
        be a remote operation; lots of network trips.
        If you have a map that is read-mostly then you should consider creating a
        <literal>Near Cache</literal>
        for the map so that reads can be much faster and consume less network traffic.
        All these benefits don't come free. When using near cache, you should consider the following issues:
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>JVM will have to hold extra cached data so it will increase the memory consumption.
                </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>If invalidation is turned on and entries are updated frequently, then invalidations will be
                    costly.
                </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Near cache breaks the strong consistency guarantees; you might be reading stale data.
                </para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        Near cache is highly recommended for the maps that are read-mostly.
        Here is a near-cache configuration for a map :
        <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<hazelcast>
    ...
    <map name="my-read-mostly-map">
        ...
        <near-cache>
            <!--
                Maximum size of the near cache. When max size is reached,
                cache is evicted based on the policy defined.
                Any integer between 0 and Integer.MAX_VALUE. 0 means
                Integer.MAX_VALUE. Default is 0.
            -->
            <max-size>5000</max-size>
            <!--
                Maximum number of seconds for each entry to stay in the near cache. Entries that are
                older than <time-to-live-seconds> will get automatically evicted from the near cache.
                Any integer between 0 and Integer.MAX_VALUE. 0 means infinite. Default is 0.
            -->
            <time-to-live-seconds>0</time-to-live-seconds>

            <!--
                Maximum number of seconds each entry can stay in the near cache as untouched (not-read).
                Entries that are not read (touched) more than <max-idle-seconds> value will get removed
                from the near cache.
                Any integer between 0 and Integer.MAX_VALUE. 0 means
                Integer.MAX_VALUE. Default is 0.
            -->
            <max-idle-seconds>60</max-idle-seconds>

            <!--
                Valid values are:
                NONE (no extra eviction, <time-to-live-seconds> may still apply),
                LRU  (Least Recently Used),
                LFU  (Least Frequently Used).
                LRU is the default.
                Regardless of the eviction policy used, <time-to-live-seconds> will still apply.
            -->
            <eviction-policy>LRU</eviction-policy>

            <!--
                Should the cached entries get evicted if the entries are changed (updated or removed).
                true of false. Default is true.
            -->
            <invalidate-on-change>true</invalidate-on-change>

        </near-cache>
    </map>
</hazelcast>
