        Hazelcast Management Center enables you to monitor and manage your servers running hazelcast.
        With Management Center, in addition to monitoring overall state of your clusters, you can also analyze
        and browse your data structures in details.
        You can also update map configurations and take thread dump from nodes.
        With its scripting module, you can run scritps (JavaScript, Groovy etc.) on your servers.
        Version 2.0 is a web based tool so you can deploy it into your internal server and serve your users.

        <para>
            It is important to understand how it actually works. Basically you will deploy
            <literal>mancenter.war</literal>
            application into your Java web server and then tell
            Hazelcast nodes to talk to that web application. That means, your Hazelcast nodes should know the
            URL of
            <literal>mancenter</literal>
            application before they start.
