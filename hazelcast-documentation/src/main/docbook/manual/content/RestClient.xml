    <para>
        Let's say your cluster's members are:
        <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[Members [5] {
    Member [10.20.17.1:5701]
    Member [10.20.17.2:5701]
    Member [10.20.17.4:5701]
    Member [10.20.17.3:5701]
    Member [10.20.17.5:5701]
 }
]]></programlisting>

        And you have a distributed map named 'stocks'. You can put a new
        <literal>key1/value1</literal>
        entry into this map
        by issuing
        <literal>HTTP POST</literal>
        call to
        <literal>http://10.20.17.1:5701/hazelcast/rest/maps/stocks/key1</literal>
        URL.
        Your http post call's content body should contain the value (value1). You can retrieve this entry via
        `HTTP GET` call to `http://10.20.17.1:5701/hazelcast/rest/maps/stocks/key1`. You can also retrieve this
        entry from another member such as<literal>http://10.20.17.3:5701/hazelcast/rest/maps/stocks/key1</literal>.

        RESTful access is provided through any member of your cluster. So you can even put an HTTP load-balancer
        in-front of your
        cluster members for load-balancing and fault-tolerance.

        Now go ahead and install a REST plugin for your browser and explore further.

        Hazelcast also stores the mime-type of your
        <literal>POST</literal>
        request if it contains any. So if, for example,
        you post binary of an image file and set the mime-type of the
        <literal>HTTP POST</literal>
        request
        to
        <literal>image/jpeg</literal>
        then this mime-type will be part of the response of your
        <literal>HTTP GET</literal>
        request for that entry.

        Let's say you also have a task queue named 'tasks'. You can offer a new item into the queue via HTTP POST and
        take
        and item from the queue via HTTP DELETE.


        HTTP POST
        http://10.20.17.1:5701/hazelcast/rest/queues/tasks
        &lt;CONTENT&gt;

        means

        <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[Hazelcast.getQueue("tasks").offer(<CONTENT>);
]]></programlisting>

        and


        HTTP DELETE
        http://10.20.17.1:5701/hazelcast/rest/queues/tasks/3

        means

        <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[Hazelcast.getQueue("tasks").poll(3, SECONDS);
]]></programlisting>

        Note that you will have to handle the failures on REST polls as there is no transactional guarantee.
