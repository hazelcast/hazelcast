    <title>Testing Cluster</title>
    <para>Hazelcast allows you to create more than one member on the same JVM. Each member is called
        <literal>HazelcastInstance</literal>
        and each will have its own configuration, socket
        and threads, so you can treat them as totally separate members. This enables us to write and
        run cluster unit tests on single JVM. As you can use this feature for creating separate
        members different applications running on the same JVM (imagine running multiple webapps on
        the same JVM), you can also use this feature for testing Hazelcast cluster.
    </para>
    <para>Let's say you want to test if two members have the same size of a map.
        <programlisting language="java">
<![CDATA[@Test
public void testTwoMemberMapSizes() {
    // start the first member
    HazelcastInstance h1 = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(null);
    // get the map and put 1000 entries
    Map map1 = h1.getMap("testmap");
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
        map1.put(i, "value" + i);
    }
    // check the map size
    assertEquals(1000, map1.size());
    // start the second member
    HazelcastInstance h2 = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(null);
    // get the same map from the second member
    Map map2 = h2.getMap("testmap");
    // check the size of map2
    assertEquals(1000, map2.size());
    // check the size of map1 again
    assertEquals(1000, map1.size());
}
]]></programlisting>In the test above, everything happened in the same thread. When developing
        multi-threaded test, coordination of the thread executions has to be carefully handled.
        Usage of
        <literal>CountDownLatch</literal>
        for thread coordination is highly recommended.
        You can certainly use other things. Here is an example where we need to listen for messages
        and make sure that we got these messages:<programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[@Test
public void testTopic() {
    // start two member cluster
    HazelcastInstance h1 = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(null);
    HazelcastInstance h2 = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(null);
    String topicName = "TestMessages";
    // get a topic from the first member and add a messageListener
    ITopic<String> topic1 = h1.getTopic(topicName);
    final CountDownLatch latch1 = new CountDownLatch(1);
    topic1.addMessageListener(new MessageListener() {
        public void onMessage(Object msg) {
            assertEquals("Test1", msg);
            latch1.countDown();
        }
    });
    // get a topic from the second member and add a messageListener
    ITopic<String> topic2 = h2.getTopic(topicName);
    final CountDownLatch latch2 = new CountDownLatch(2);
    topic2.addMessageListener(new MessageListener() {
        public void onMessage(Object msg) {
            assertEquals("Test1", msg);
            latch2.countDown();
        }
    });
    // publish the first message, both should receive this
    topic1.publish("Test1");
    // shutdown the first member
    h1.shutdown();
    // publish the second message, second member's topic should receive this
    topic2.publish("Test1");
    try {
        // assert that the first member's topic got the message
        assertTrue(latch1.await(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS));
        // assert that the second members' topic got two messages
        assertTrue(latch2.await(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS));
    } catch (InterruptedException ignored) {
    }
}
]]></programlisting>
        Also remember to call
        <literal>Hazelcast.shutdownAll()</literal>
        after each test
        case to make sure that there is no other running member left from the previous tests.<programlisting
                language="java"><![CDATA[@After

    Hazelcast.shutdownAll();
