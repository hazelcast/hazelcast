        Hazelcast is the distributed implementation of several structures that exist in Java. Most of the time
        it behaves as you expect. However there are some design choices in Hazelcast that violate some contracts.
        This page will list those violations.

        # *equals() and hashCode() methods for the objects stored in Hazelcast*
        When you store a key, value in a distributed Map, Hazelcast serializes the key and value and stores
        the byte array version of them in local ConcurrentHashMaps. And this ConcurrentHashMap uses the equals and
        hashCode methods of byte array version of your key. So it does not take into account the actual equals and
        hashCode implementations of your objects. So it is important that you choose your keys in a proper way.
        Implementing the equals and hashCode is not enough, it is also important that the object is always serialized
        into the same byte array. All primitive types, like; String, Long, Integer and etc. are good candidates for
        keys to use in Hazelcast. An unsorted Set is an example of a very bad candidate because Java Serialization may
        serialize the same unsorted set in two different byte arrays.

        Note that the distributed Set and List stores its entries as the keys in a distributed Map. So the
        notes above apply to the objects you store in Set and List.
