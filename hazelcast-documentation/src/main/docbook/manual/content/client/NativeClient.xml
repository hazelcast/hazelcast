    <title>Native Client</title>
    <para>Native Client enables you to do all Hazelcast operations without being a member of the
        cluster. It connects to one of the cluster members and delegates all cluster wide operations
        to it. When the relied cluster member dies, client will transparently switch to another live
        member.
    </para>
    <para>There can be hundreds, even thousands of clients connected to the cluster. But by default there is 40 threads
        on server side that will handle all the requests. You may want to increase
        hazelcast.executor.client.thread.count
        property for better performance.
    </para>
    <para>Imagine a trading application where all the trading data stored and managed in a 10 node
        Hazelcast cluster. Swing/Web applications at traders' desktops can use Native Java Client to
        access and modify the data in the Hazelcast cluster.
    </para>
    <para>Currently Hazelcast has Native Java and C# Client available.

                LiteMember vs. Native Client
            </emphasis>
        </emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>LiteMember is a member of the cluster, it has socket connection to every member in the
        cluster and it knows where the data is so it will get to the data much faster. But LiteMember
        has the clustering overhead and it must be on the same data center even on the same
        RAC. However Native client is not member and relies on one of the cluster members. Native
        Clients can be anywhere in the LAN or WAN. It scales much better and overhead is quite less.
        So if your clients are less than Hazelcast nodes then LiteMember can be an option;
        otherwise definitely try Native Client. As a rule of thumb: Try Native client first, if it
        doesn't perform well enough for you, then consider LiteMember.
    </para>
    <para>The following picture describes the clients connecting to Hazelcast Cluster. Note the
        difference between LiteMember and Java Client

        <para>You can do almost all hazelcast operations with Java Client. It already implements the
            same interface. You must include hazelcast-client.jar into your classpath.

        <para>
            By default, near Cache on Java Client is not enabled. Near Cache implementation on client side is based
            on the Google
            <ulink url="http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/CachesExplained">Guava</ulink>
            cache. To enable it the following System property should be set
            to "true": "hazelcast.client.near.cache.enabled" and the related Guava jar's should be added to classpath.
            The current implementation uses 13.0.1 version of it.

            You can add the maven dependency as follows:

            <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.google.guava</groupId>
        <artifactId>guava</artifactId>
        <version>13.0.1</version>
    </dependency>

            ]]></programlisting>

            Client will use the near cache configuration on server for the maps. Only the maps having
            proper near cache configuration will be cached on client. If max size is set, entries will be evicted
            based on LRU eviction policy, as this is the only policy that Guava supports.

        <para>You can use native C# client to connect to the running Hazelcast instances. All you need is to include
            Hazelcast.Client.dll into your C# project. The API is very similar to Java native client. Note that C#
            client
            doesn't have automatic reconnection feature. If the node that it connected dies, it will not switch to
            another member.
            User must connect to another member itself.

            You can serialize back and forth Java and C# Objects between C# client and Hazelcast server.
            All you need is to have your classes that you want to share to implement DataSerializable both on Java and
            C#
            in the exact same way. And on C# ClientConfig you must set a TypeConverter implementation that will convert
            Java Class name into C# Type and vice versa.

            A basic TypeConverter might look like this.
            <programlisting language="CSharp"><![CDATA[

public class MyTypeConverter: Hazelcast.IO.ITypeConverter

    public string getJavaName(Type type)

            return "com.hazelcast.examples.MyClass";

        return null;
    }

    public Type getType(String javaName)
    {
        if("com.hazelcast.examples.MyClass".Equals(javaName))

        return null;
    }
}

            A basic MyCSharpClass implementing DataSerializable
