    <title>EC2 Auto Discovery</title>
    <para>Hazelcast supports EC2 Auto Discovery as of 1.9.4. It is useful when you don't want or
        can't provide the list of possible IP addresses. Here is a sample configuration:
        Disable join over multicast and tcp/ip and enable aws. Also provide the credentials.
        The aws tag accepts an attribute called "conn-timeout-seconds". The default value is 5.
        Increasing this value is recommended if you have many IP's listed and members can not properly build up the
        cluster.

        You need to add hazelcast-cloud.jar dependency into your project. Note that it is
        also bundled inside hazelcast-all.jar. hazelcast-cloud module doesn't depend on any other third party modules.
