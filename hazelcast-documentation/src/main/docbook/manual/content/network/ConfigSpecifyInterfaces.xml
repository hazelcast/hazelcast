    <title>Specifying Network Interfaces</title>
    <para>
        You can also specify which network interfaces that Hazelcast should use. Servers mostly have more than one
        network
        interface so you may want to list the valid IPs. Range characters ('*' and '-') can be used for simplicity. So
        10.3.10.*, for instance, refers to IPs between 10.3.10.0 and 10.3.10.255. Interface 10.3.10.4-18 refers to IPs
        between 10.3.10.4 and 10.3.10.18 (4 and 18 included). If network interface configuration is enabled (disabled by
        default) and if Hazelcast cannot find an matching interface, then it will print a message on console and won't
        start on that node.
