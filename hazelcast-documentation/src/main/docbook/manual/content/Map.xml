    <title>Distributed Map</title>
    <para>Just like queue and set, Hazelcast will partition your map entries; and almost evenly
        distribute onto all Hazelcast members. Distributed maps have 1 backup (replica-count) by
        default so that if a member goes down, we don't lose data. Backup operations are synchronous
        so when a <literal>map.put(key, value)</literal> returns, it is guaranteed that the entry is
        replicated to one other node. For the reads, it is also guaranteed that
            <literal>map.get(key)</literal> returns the latest value of the entry. Consistency is
        strictly enforced. <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[import com.hazelcast.core.Hazelcast;

        <title>Backups</title>
        <para> Hazelcast will distribute map entries onto multiple JVMs (cluster members). Each JVM
            holds some portion of the data but we don't want to lose data when a member JVM crashes.
            To provide data-safety, Hazelcast allows you to specify the number of backup copies you
            want to have. That way data on a JVM will be synchronously copied onto other JVM(s). By
            default, Hazelcast will have one backup copy. Backup operations
                are<emphasis>synchronous</emphasis>. When a <literal>map.put(key,value)</literal>
            call returns, it means entry is updated on the both owner and backup JVMs. If backup
            count &gt;= 1, then each member will carry both owned entries and backup copies of other
            member(s). So for the <literal>map.get(key)</literal> call, it is possible that calling
            member has backup copy of that key but by default, <literal>map.get(key)</literal> will always read the
            value from the actual owner of the key for consistency. It is possible to enable backup
            reads by changing the configuration. Enabling backup reads will give you greater
            performance. <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<hazelcast>

        <para>Not always. Cluster member list is the same on each member. Hazelcast will backup each
            member's data onto next members in the member list. Let say you have a cluster with
            members A, B, C, D, E, F, G and the backup-count is 1, then Hazelcast will copy A's data
            onto B, B's data onto C... and G's data onto A. If A and B crashes at the same time then
            you will lose data because B was the backup of A. But A and C crashes at the same time,
            you won't lose any data because B was the backup of A and D was the backup of C. So you

        <title>Eviction</title>
        <para>Hazelcast also supports policy based eviction for distributed map. Currently supported
            eviction policies are LRU (Least Recently Used) and LFU (Least Frequently Used). This
            feature enables Hazelcast to be used as a distributed cache. If
                <literal>time-to-live-seconds</literal> is not 0 then entries older than
                <literal>time-to-live-seconds</literal> value will get evicted, regardless of the
            eviction policy set. Here is a sample configuration for eviction: <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<hazelcast>

        <para><emphasis role="bold"> Criteria API</emphasis></para>
        <para>If SQL is not enough or programmable queries are preferred then JPA criteria like API
            can be used. Here is an example: <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[import com.hazelcast.core.IMap;
import com.hazelcast.query.Predicate;
import com.hazelcast.query.PredicateBuilder;
import com.hazelcast.query.EntryObject;

IMap map = Hazelcast.getMap("employee");

EntryObject e = new PredicateBuilder().getEntryObject();
Predicate predicate = e.is("active").and(e.get("age").lessThan(30));

Set<Employee> employees = (Set<Employee>) map.values(predicate);

]]></programlisting></para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Indexing</emphasis></para>
        <para>Hazelcast distributed queries will run on each member in parallel and only results
            will return the caller. When a query runs on a member, Hazelcast will iterate through
            the entire owned entries and find the matching ones. Can we make this even faster? Yes
            by indexing the mostly queried fields. Just like you would do for your database. Of
            course, indexing will add overhead for each <literal>write</literal> operation but
            queries will be a lot faster. If you are querying your map a lot then make sure to add
            indexes for most frequently queried fields. So if your <literal>active and age &lt;
                30</literal> query, for example, is used a lot then make sure you add index for
                <literal>active</literal> and <literal>age</literal> fields. Here is how: <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[IMap imap = Hazelcast.getMap("employees");
imap.addIndex("age", true);        // ordered, since we have ranged queries for this field
imap.addIndex("active", false);    // not ordered, because boolean field cannot have range
]]></programlisting> API <literal>IMap.addIndex(fieldName, ordered)</literal> is used for adding
            index. For a each indexed field, if you have -ranged- queries such
                as<literal>age&gt;30</literal>, <literal>age BETWEEN 40 AND 60</literal> then
                <literal>ordered</literal> parameter should be<literal>true</literal>, otherwise set
            it to<literal>false</literal>. </para>

        <title>Near Cache</title>
        <para>Map entries in Hazelcast are partitioned across the cluster. Imagine that you are
            reading key
            <literal>k</literal>
            so many times and
            <literal>k</literal>
            is owned by another member in your cluster. Each
            <literal>map.get(k)</literal>
            will
            be a remote operation; lots of network trips.
            If you have a map that is read-mostly then you should consider creating a
            <literal>Near Cache</literal>
            for the map so that reads can be much faster and consume less network traffic.
            All these benefits don't come free. When using near cache, you should consider the following issues:
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>JVM will have to hold extra cached data so it will increase the memory consumption.

                <listitem>
                    <para>If invalidation is turned on and entries are updated frequently, then invalidations will be
                        costly.

                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Near cache breaks the strong consistency guarantees; you might be reading stale data.
                    </para>
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
            Near cache is highly recommended for the maps that are read-mostly.
            Here is a near-cache configuration for a map :
            <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<hazelcast>
    ...
    <map name="my-read-mostly-map">
        ...
        <near-cache>
            <!--
                Maximum number of seconds for each entry to stay in the near cache. Entries that are
                older than <time-to-live-seconds> will get automatically evicted from the near cache.
                Any integer between 0 and Integer.MAX_VALUE. 0 means infinite. Default is 0.
            -->
            <time-to-live-seconds>0</time-to-live-seconds>

            <!--
                Maximum number of seconds each entry can stay in the near cache as untouched (not-read).
                Entries that are not read (touched) more than <max-idle-seconds> value will get removed
                from the near cache.
                Any integer between 0 and Integer.MAX_VALUE. 0 means
                Integer.MAX_VALUE. Default is 0.

            Hazelcast keeps extra information about each map entry such as creationTime, lastUpdateTime, lastAccessTime,
            number of hits, version, and this information is exposed to the developer via
            <literal>IMap.getMapEntry(key)</literal>
            call. Here is
            an example:
            <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[import com.hazelcast.core.Hazelcast;
import com.hazelcast.core.MapEntry;

MapEntry entry = Hazelcast.getMap("quotes").getMapEntry("1");

System.out.println ("creationTime    : " + entry.getCreationTime();
System.out.println ("expirationTime  : " + entry.getExpirationTime();
System.out.println ("number of hits  : " + entry.getHits();
System.out.println ("lastAccessedTime: " + entry.getLastAccessTime();
