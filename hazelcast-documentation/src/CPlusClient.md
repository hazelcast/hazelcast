## C++ Client

![](images/enterprise-onlycopy.jpg)


You can use Native C++ Client to connect to Hazelcast nodes and perform almost all operations that a node can perform. Clients differ from nodes in that clients do not hold data. The C++ Client is by default a smart client, i.e. it knows where the data is and asks directly for the correct node. You can disable this feature (using the `ClientConfig::setSmart` method) if you do not want the clients to connect to every node.

The features of C++ Clients are:

- Access to distributed data structures (IMap, IQueue, MultiMap, ITopic, etc.).
- Access to transactional distributed data structures (TransactionalMap, TransactionalQueue, etc.).
- Ability to add cluster listeners to a cluster and entry/item listeners to distributed data structures.
- Distributed synchronization mechanisms with ILock, ISemaphore and ICountDownLatch.


### How to Setup

Hazelcast C++ Client is shipped with 32/64 bit, shared and static libraries. Compiled static libraries of dependencies are also available in the release. Dependencies are **zlib** and **shared_ptr** from the boost libraries. 


The downloaded release folder consists of:

- Mac_64/
- Windows_32/
- Windows_64/
- Linux_32/
- Linux_64/
- docs/ *(HTML Doxygen documents are here)*


Each of the folders above contains the following:

- examples/
	- testApp.exe => example command line client tool to connect hazelcast servers.
	- TestApp.cpp => code of the example command line tool.

- hazelcast/
	- lib/ => Contains both shared and static library of hazelcast.
	- include/ => Contains headers of client.

-	external/
	- lib/ => Contains compiled static libraries of zlib.
	- include/ => Contains headers of dependencies. (zlib and boost::shared_ptr)



### Platform Specific Installation Guides
The C++ Client is tested on Linux 32/64, Mac 64 and Windows 32/64 bit machines. For each of the headers above, it is assumed that you are in the correct folder for your platform. Folders are Mac_64, Windows_32, Windows_64, Linux_32 or Linux_64.

#### Linux

For Linux, there are two distributions: 32 bit and 64 bit.

Here is an example script to build with static library:

`g++ main.cpp -pthread -I./external/include -I./hazelcast/include 
     ./hazelcast/lib/libHazelcastClientStatic_64.a 
     ./external/lib/libz.a`

Here is an example script to build with shared library:

`g++ main.cpp -lpthread -Wl,â€“no-as-needed -lrt -I./external/include -I./hazelcast/include -L./hazelcast/lib -lHazelcastClientShared_64 ./external/lib/libz.a`

#### Mac
For Mac, there is one distribution: 64 bit.

Here is an example script to build with static library:

`g++ main.cpp -I./external/include -I./hazelcast/include ./hazelcast/lib/libHazelcastClientStatic_64.a ./external/lib/darwin/libz.a`

Here is an example script to build with shared library:

`g++ main.cpp -I./external/include -I./hazelcast/include -L./hazelcast/lib -lHazelcastClientShared_64 ./external/lib/darwin/libz.a`

#### Windows
For Windows, there are two distributions; 32 bit and 64 bit. The current release has only Visual Studio 2010 compatible libraries. For others, please contact [support@hazelcast.com](support@hazelcast.com).

### Code Examples
A Hazelcast node should be running to make the example code below work.

#### Map Example

```cpp
#include <hazelcast/client/HazelcastAll.h>
#include <iostream>

using namespace hazelcast::client;

int main() {
  ClientConfig clientConfig;
  Address address( "localhost", 5701 );
  clientConfig.addAddress( address );

  HazelcastClient hazelcastClient( clientConfig );

  IMap<int,int> myMap = hazelcastClient.getMap<int ,int>( "myIntMap" );
  myMap.put( 1,3 );
  boost::shared_ptr<int> value = myMap.get( 1 );
  if( value.get() != NULL ) {
    //process the item
  }

  return 0;
}
```

#### Queue Example

```cpp
#include <hazelcast/client/HazelcastAll.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace hazelcast::client;

int main() {
  ClientConfig clientConfig;
  Address address( "localhost", 5701 );
  clientConfig.addAddress( address );

  HazelcastClient hazelcastClient( clientConfig );

  IQueue<std::string> queue = hazelcastClient.getQueue<std::string>( "q" );
  queue.offer( "sample" );
  boost::shared_ptr<std::string> value = queue.poll();
  if( value.get() != NULL ) {
    //process the item
  }
  return 0;
}
```

#### Entry Listener Example

```cpp
#include "hazelcast/client/ClientConfig.h"
#include "hazelcast/client/EntryEvent.h"
#include "hazelcast/client/IMap.h"
#include "hazelcast/client/Address.h"
#include "hazelcast/client/HazelcastClient.h"
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace hazelcast::client;

class SampleEntryListener {
  public:

  void entryAdded( EntryEvent<std::string, std::string> &event ) {
    std::cout << "entry added " <<  event.getKey() << " "
        << event.getValue() << std::endl;
  };

  void entryRemoved( EntryEvent<std::string, std::string> &event ) {
    std::cout << "entry added " <<  event.getKey() << " " 
        << event.getValue() << std::endl;
  }

  void entryUpdated( EntryEvent<std::string, std::string> &event ) {
    std::cout << "entry added " <<  event.getKey() << " " 
        << event.getValue() << std::endl;
  }

  void entryEvicted( EntryEvent<std::string, std::string> &event ) {
    std::cout << "entry added " <<  event.getKey() << " " 
        << event.getValue() << std::endl;
  }
};


int main( int argc, char **argv ) {
  ClientConfig clientConfig;
  Address address( "localhost", 5701 );
  clientConfig.addAddress( address );

  HazelcastClient hazelcastClient( clientConfig );

  IMap<std::string,std::string> myMap = hazelcastClient
      .getMap<std::string ,std::string>( "myIntMap" );
  SampleEntryListener *  listener = new SampleEntryListener();

  std::string id = myMap.addEntryListener( *listener, true );
  // Prints entryAdded
  myMap.put( "key1", "value1" );
  // Prints updated
  myMap.put( "key1", "value2" );
  // Prints entryRemoved
  myMap.remove( "key1" );
  // Prints entryEvicted after 1 second
  myMap.put( "key2", "value2", 1000 );

  // WARNING: deleting listener before removing it from hazelcast leads to crashes.
  myMap.removeEntryListener( id );
  // Delete listener after remove it from hazelcast.
  delete listener;               
  return 0;
};
```

#### Serialization Example
Assume that you have the following two classes in Java and you want to use them with a C++ client. 

```java
class Foo implements Serializable {
  private int age;
  private String name;
}

class Bar implements Serializable {
  private float x;
  private float y;
} 
```

**First**, let them implement `Portable` or `IdentifiedDataSerializable` as shown below.

```java
class Foo implements Portable {
  private int age;
  private String name;

  public int getFactoryId() {
    // a positive id that you choose
    return 123;
  }

  public int getClassId() {
    // a positive id that you choose
    return 2;     
  }

  public void writePortable( PortableWriter writer ) throws IOException {
    writer.writeUTF( "n", name );
    writer.writeInt( "a", age );
  }

  public void readPortable( PortableReader reader ) throws IOException {
    name = reader.readUTF( "n" );
    age = reader.readInt( "a" );
  }
}

class Bar implements IdentifiedDataSerializable {
  private float x;
  private float y;

  public int getFactoryId() {
    // a positive id that you choose
    return 4;     
  }

  public int getId() {
    // a positive id that you choose
    return 5;    
  }

  public void writeData( ObjectDataOutput out ) throws IOException {
    out.writeFloat( x );
    out.writeFloat( y );
  }

  public void readData( ObjectDataInput in ) throws IOException {
    x = in.readFloat();
    y = in.readFloat();
  }
}
```

**Then**, implement the corresponding classes in C++ with same factory and class ID as shown below.

```cpp
class Foo : public Portable {
  public:
  int getFactoryId() const {
    return 123;
  };

  int getClassId() const {
    return 2;
  };

  void writePortable( serialization::PortableWriter &writer ) const {
    writer.writeUTF( "n", name );
    writer.writeInt( "a", age );
  };

  void readPortable( serialization::PortableReader &reader ) {
    name = reader.readUTF( "n" );
    age = reader.readInt( "a" );
  };

  private:
  int age;
  std::string name;
};

class Bar : public IdentifiedDataSerializable {
  public:
  int getFactoryId() const {
    return 4;
  };

  int getClassId() const {
    return 2;
  };

  void writeData( serialization::ObjectDataOutput& out ) const {
    out.writeFloat(x);
    out.writeFloat(y);
  };

  void readData( serialization::ObjectDataInput& in ) {
    x = in.readFloat();
    y = in.readFloat();
  };
  
  private:
  float x;
  float y;
};
```

Now, you can use the classes `Foo` and `Bar` in distributed structures. For example, use as Key or Value of `IMap` or as an Item in `IQueue`.
