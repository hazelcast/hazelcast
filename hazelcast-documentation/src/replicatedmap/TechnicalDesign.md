### Technical design

There are several technical design decisions that worth mentioning. We strongly suggest reading the following section
to be aware of the configurable behavior.

**Initial provisioning**

If a new member joins, there are two ways of handling the initial provisioning that is executed to replicate all existing
values to the new member.

First of all, you can have an async fill up which does not block reads while fill up operation is underway. That way,
you have immediate access on the new member but it will take time until all values are eventually accessible. Not yet
replicated values are returned as non existing (null).
Write operations to already existing keys during this async phase can be lost since the vector clock for an entry
might not be initialized by another member yet and might be seen as an old update by other members.

The second way is to have a synchronous initial fill up which blocks every read or write access to the map until the
fill up operation is finished. This way should be used with caution since it might block your application from operation.

**Replication delay**

By default, the replication of values is delayed by 100 milliseconds when no current waiting replication is found. This is used
to collect multiple updates and to minimize the operations overhead on replication. A hard limit of 1000 replications
is built into the system to prevent `OutOfMemory` situations where you put lots of data into the replicated map in a really
short time.
The delay is configurable and a value of "0" means immediate replication. That way, you can configure the trade off between
replication overhead and time for the value to be replicated.

**Concurrency Level**

The concurrency level configuration is used to define the number of mutexes and segments inside the replicated map storage.
A mutex/segment is chosen by calculating the `hashCode` of the key and using module by the concurrency level. If multiple
keys fall into the same mutex ,they will have to wait for other mutex holders on the same mutex to finish their operation.

For high amount of values or high contention on the mutexes, this value might be interesting to be changed.
