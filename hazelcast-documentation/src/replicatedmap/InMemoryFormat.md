### In Memory Format on ReplicatedMap

Currently two `in-memory-format` values are usable with the ReplicatedMap.

- `OBJECT` (default): The data will be stored in deserialized form. This configuration is the default choice since
data replication is mostly used for high speed access. Please be aware that changing values without a `Map::put` is
not reflected on other nodes but is visible on the changing nodes for later value accesses.

- `BINARY`: The data is stored in serialized binary format and has to be deserialized on every request. This
option offers higher encapsulation since changes to values are always discarded as long as the newly changed object is
not explicitly `Map::put` into the map again.
