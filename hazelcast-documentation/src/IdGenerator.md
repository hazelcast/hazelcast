## Cluster-wide Id Generator

Hazelcast IdGenerator creates cluster-wide unique IDs. Generated IDs are long type primitive values between 0 and `Long.MAX_VALUE` . Id generation occurs almost at the speed of `AtomicLong.incrementAndGet()` . Generated IDs are unique during the life cycle of the cluster. If the entire cluster is restarted, IDs start from 0 again or you can initialize to a value.

```java
import com.hazelcast.core.IdGenerator;
import com.hazelcast.core.Hazelcast;

Config cfg = new Config();
HazelcastInstance hz = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(cfg);
IdGenerator idGenerator = hz.getIdGenerator("customer-ids");
idGenerator.init(123L); //Optional
long id = idGenerator.newId();
```
