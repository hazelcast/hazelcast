## System Properties

Hazelcast has system properties to tune some aspects of Hazelcast. You can set them as property name and value pairs through declarative configuration, programmatic configuration or JVM system property.

**Declarative Configuration**

```xml
<hazelcast xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/config
    http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/config/hazelcast-config-3.0.xsd"
    xmlns="http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/config"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">

  ....
  <properties>
    <property name="hazelcast.property.foo">value</property>
    ....
  </properties>
</hazelcast>
```
**Programmatic Configuration**

```java
Config config = new Config() ;
config.setProperty( "hazelcast.property.foo", "value" );
```

**System Property**

1. Using JVM parameter: `java -Dhazelcast.property.foo=value`

2. Using System class: `System.setProperty( "hazelcast.property.foo", "value" );`

The table below lists the system properties with their descriptions in alphabetical order.

`hazelcast.socket.no.delay` | true | bool  |   Socket set TCP no delay.
`hazelcast.socket.receive.buffer.size` | 32 | int | Socket receive buffer (`SO_RCVBUF`) size in KB. If you have a very fast network (e.g. 10gbit) and/or you have large entries, then you may benefit from increasing sender/receiver buffer sizes. Use this property and the next one below tune the size.
