### Backups


Hazelcast will distribute map entries onto multiple JVMs (cluster members). Each JVM holds some portion of the data but we don't want to lose data when a member JVM crashes. To provide data-safety, Hazelcast allows you to specify the number of backup copies you want to have. That way data on a JVM will be copied onto other JVM(s). Hazelcast supports both `sync` and `async` backups. `Sync` backups block operations until backups are successfully copied to backups nodes (or deleted from backup nodes in case of remove) and acknowledgements are received. In contrast, `async` backups do not block operations, they are fire & forget and do not require acknowledgements. By default, Hazelcast will have one sync backup copy. If backup count \>= 1, then each member will carry both owned entries and backup copies of other member(s). So for the `map.get(key)` call, it is possible that calling member has backup copy of that key but by default, `map.get(key)` will always read the value from the actual owner of the key for consistency. It is possible to enable backup reads by changing the configuration. Enabling backup reads will give you greater performance.

```xml
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <map name="default">
        <!--
            Number of sync-backups. If 1 is set as the backup-count for example,
            then all entries of the map will be copied to another JVM for
            fail-safety. Valid numbers are 0 (no backup), 1, 2, 3.
        -->
        <backup-count>1</backup-count>

        <!--
            Number of async-backups. If 1 is set as the backup-count for example,
            then all entries of the map will be copied to another JVM for
            fail-safety. Valid numbers are 0 (no backup), 1, 2, 3.
        -->
        <async-backup-count>1</async-backup-count>

        <!--
            Can we read the local backup entries? Default value is false for
            strong consistency. Being able to read backup data will give you
            greater performance.
        -->
        <read-backup-data>false</read-backup-data>

        ...
    </map>
</hazelcast>
