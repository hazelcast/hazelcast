### Persistence

Hazelcast allows you to load and store the distributed map entries from/to a persistent datastore such as relational database. If a loader implementation is provided, when `get(key)` is called, if the map entry doesn't exist in-memory then Hazelcast will call your loader implementation to load the entry from a datastore. If a store implementation is provided, when `put(key,value)` is called, Hazelcast will call your store implementation to store the entry into a datastore. Hazelcast can call your implementation to store the entries synchronously (write-through) with no-delay or asynchronously (write-behind) with delay and it is defined by the `write-delay-seconds` value in the configuration.

If it is write-through, when the `map.put(key,value)` call returns, you can be sure that

-   `MapStore.store(key,value)` is successfully called so the entry is persisted.

-   In-Memory entry is updated

-   In-Memory backup copies are successfully created on other JVMs (if backup-count is greater than 0)

If it is write-behind, when the `map.put(key,value)` call returns, you can be sure that

-   In-Memory entry is updated

-   In-Memory backup copies are successfully created on other JVMs (if backup-count is greater than 0)

-   The entry is marked as `dirty` so that after `write-delay-seconds`, it can be persisted.

Same behavior goes for the `remove(key` and `MapStore.delete(key)`. If `MapStore` throws an exception then the exception will be propagated back to the original `put` or `remove` call in the form of `RuntimeException`. When write-through is used, Hazelcast will call `MapStore.store(key,value)` and `MapStore.delete(key)` for each entry update. When write-behind is used, Hazelcast will call`MapStore.store(map)`, and `MapStore.delete(collection)` to do all writes in a single call. Also note that your MapStore or MapLoader implementation should not use Hazelcast Map/Queue/MultiMap/List/Set operations. Your implementation should only work with your data store. Otherwise you may get into deadlock situations.

Here is a sample configuration:

```xml
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <map name="default">
        ...
        <map-store enabled="true">
            <!--
               Name of the class implementing MapLoader and/or MapStore.
               The class should implement at least of these interfaces and
               contain no-argument constructor. Note that the inner classes are not supported.
            -->
            <class-name>com.hazelcast.examples.DummyStore</class-name>
            <!--
               Number of seconds to delay to call the MapStore.store(key, value).
               If the value is zero then it is write-through so MapStore.store(key, value)
               will be called as soon as the entry is updated.
               Otherwise it is write-behind so updates will be stored after write-delay-seconds
               value by calling Hazelcast.storeAll(map). Default value is 0.
            -->
            <write-delay-seconds>0</write-delay-seconds>
        </map-store>
    </map>
</hazelcast>
```
#### Initialization on startup: ####

`MapLoader.loadAllKeys` API is used for pre-populating the in-memory map when the map is first touched/used. If `MapLoader.loadAllKeys` returns NULL then nothing will be loaded. Your `MapLoader.loadAllKeys` implementation can return all or some of the keys. You may select and return only the `hot` keys, for instance. Also note that this is the fastest way of pre-populating the map as Hazelcast will optimize the loading process by having each node loading owned portion of the entries.

Here is MapLoader initialization flow;

1.  When `getMap()` first called from any node, initialization starts

2.  Hazelcast will call `MapLoader.loadAllKeys()` to get all your keys on each node

3.  Each node will figure out the list of keys it owns

4.  Each node will load all its owned keys by calling `MapLoader.loadAll(keys)`

5.  Each node puts its owned entries into the map by calling `IMap.putTransient(key,value)`

#### Post Processing Map Store: ####

In some scenarios, you may need to modify the object after storing it into the map store.
For example you can get id or version auto generated by your database and you need to modify your object stored in distributed map,
not to break the sync between database and data grid. You can do that by implementing `PostProcessingMapStore` interface;
so the modified object will put to the distributed map. That will cause an extra step of `Serialization`, so use it just when needed.(This explanation is only valid when using `write-through` map store configuration.)

Here an example of post processing map store:

```java
class ProcessingStore extends MapStore<Integer, Employee> implements PostProcessingMapStore {
	@Override
	public void store(Integer key, Employee employee) {
	EmployeeId id = saveEmployee();
	employee.setId(id.getId());
}
```
