[kafka] Kafka version updated to 1.0.0
[hadoop] Hadoop version updated to 2.8.3

3. Fixes

[core] Avoid race between job cancellation and completion [#604]
[core] Do not send a join request for a job unless Job.join() is explicitly called [#628]
[core] When master node leaves cluster, job would restart even if auto-restart was disabled [#683]
[core] When using map source, returning null in a projection would cause rest of the items to be dropped [#669]
[core] When DAG fails to deserialize on job submission from client, the exception was not returned to user [#794]
[core] Fix for `ClassNotFoundException` when restoring from snapshot when the key class is not on Jet classpath [#778]
[core] Assert that always same item offered to Outbox after a rejection [#808]
[kafka] Kafka sink should ensure that all records are sent before snapshot [#611]
[kafka/hadoop] Package names reorganized to have better support for module systems

4. Breaking Changes

[pipeline-api] Grouping and aggregation in Pipeline API now done through .groupingKey() and .aggregate() methods
[pipeline-api] Package names for Pipeline API have been reorganized.
[core] Job cancellation can now only be done through Job.cancel() rather than Job.getFuture().cancel()
[core] IStreamMap, IStreamList and IStreamCache respectively renamed to IMapJet, IListJet and ICacheJet
[core] Dedicated tryProcessWatermark() method is now responsible for processing Watermarks in a processor
and watermarks will be forwarded automatically once it returns true.
[core] start-jet.sh, submit-jet.sh and other scripts renamed to have prefix "jet" instead.
[core] `CloseableProcessorSupplier` is replaced with a `close()`` method on Processor instead.
[core] `complete` methods on `ProcessorMetaSupplier` and `ProcessorSupplier` have been renamed to `close()`
[java.util.stream] DistributedStream creation moved to DistributedStream class from Map and List instances. We strongly
suggest to switch to Pipeline API instead of java.util.stream API.

4. Code Samples Improvements

* Overall module reorganization roughly divided to code samples using pipeline API and core API.
* Several examples migrated to use the new pipeline API
* New examples using hash join enrichment and co group
* New code samples illustrating the new event journal and fault tolerance features
* New code samples showing how to use HDFS with java.util.stream
