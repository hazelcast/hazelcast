** Hazelcast Jet 3.0 **

* 3.0 is the first major release of Hazelcast Jet past 0.x, and is versioned at 3.x to align
it better with IMDG 3.x versions that it is based on
* Starting with 3.0, main Job API and the pipeline API will be backward-compatible in further minor
versions. Core API will only be compatible between patch versions.
  - Several APIs have been streamlined in preparation for this change. Please see the breaking changes
  section of the release notes for a list of specific changes.
* Pipeline API has the following new additions:
  - Support for async map/filter/flatMapUsingContext methods
  - Support for emitting early results for a window before a window has completed
* Being able to atomically create a job only if it's not already running using
  JetInstance.newJobIfAbsent
* [Jet Enterprise] Support for job upgrades and A/B testing via taking a named snapshot and then starting the job
  from the saved snapshot.
* [Jet Enterprise] Being able to restart the whole cluster and restoring jobs by using
  IMDG Hot Restart to persist the cluster to disk
* New Jet Command Line Interface for job management of a cluster
* Support for improved Watermark diagnostics in Jet Management Center
* Support for showing map stats in Jet Management Center
* Full support for JDK 11
* Update Hazelcast version to 3.12

** Hazelcast Jet 0.7.2 **

* Fix for missing config schema file in previous release

** Hazelcast Jet 0.7.1 **

* Full support for running Hazelcast Jet on Kubernetes
* Hazelcast Jet Helm Charts are released
* TopN and BottomN aggregate operations are added

** Hazelcast Jet 0.7 **

* Several new additions to pipeline API including:
  - A new SourceBuilder API which can be used to build both streaming and batch sources
  - Merge and distinct operations
  - Simplified ways to do aggregations on more than one input (co-aggregation)
  - Support for rolling aggregations
  - Keyed map/flatMap/filterUsingContext operations
  - Convenience functions for enriching a stream directly from an IMap or ReplicatedMap
* Several additions to job management:
  - Jobs can now be automatically both scaled up and down without disruption when new nodes are added or removed.
  - Jobs can now be suspended and resumed.
* Several new default connectors are added:
  - JMS
  - JDBC
  - Avro Files
* Distributed java.util.stream implementation has been removed with this release.
  Please refer to the Pipeline API instead.
* It's now possible to get Jet metrics through a JMX interface.

* Add support for configuring a custom classloader per job
* Update Hazelcast version to final released version (3.10)

** Hazelcast Jet 0.6 **

* Pipeline API has been extended with support for windowing operations
including co grouped windows and support for event time.
* Pipeline API now allows stateful transforms using a context object.
* Parallelism and name of each stage on the pipeline API can now be set individually.
* New custom sink builder for building sink connectors without writing custom processors.
* Merging and updating map sinks, which can update a value in place rather than overwriting it.
* It is now possible to set names for jobs and retrieve them by name.
* Running jobs can now be manually restarted and scaled up.
* Spring integration module which brings support for XML and annotation
based Spring configuration

* Generalization of AggregateOperation abstraction to support multiple inbound
  streams.
* Improved job lifecycle management - jobs can now be restarted automatically
  when a node leaves the cluster.
* Exactly-once and at-least-once processing guarantees when restarting streaming
  jobs with use of distributed in memory snapshotting.
* New streaming source from IMap and ICache using Hazelcast event journal
* Support for predicates and projections when reading from Hazelcast IMap
* Ability to create a distributed java.util.stream from any source.
* Update Hazelcast version to 3.9.

** Hazelcast Jet 0.4 **

* Improved streaming support including windowing support with event-time semantics.
* Out of the box support for tumbling, sliding and session window aggregations.
