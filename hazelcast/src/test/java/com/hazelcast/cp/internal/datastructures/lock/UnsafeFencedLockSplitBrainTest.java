/**
 * Demonstrates locking issue when lock hangs in the locked state
 * when it should be in unlocked state
 *
 * This test is for issue https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/17260
 *
 * Sequence of events (simplest version):
 * - two nodes
 * - second (non-master) node is where all locking operations happen
 * - second node locks the lock
 * - master node is frozen out
 * - second node unlocks the lock
 * - master node unfrozen
 *
 * In this case, since the second node just locks and unlocks the same lock
 * when the master node is brought back on-line then the lock should remain unlocked
 * However, the lock becomes locked again about 90% of the time.
 *
 * Looks like master node directs the second node to be in it's remembered state,
 * which is wrong.
