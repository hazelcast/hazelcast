/**
 * THis is a test for https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-enterprise/issues/2492
 * The cause of the problem is the new pipeline in 3.11.
 * In the old approach, the channel wasn't registered before the connection was established.
 * So in case of failure, nothing needs to be unregistered.
 * But with the new pipeline the channel gets registered (created) before the connection is established
 * but it didn't get unregistered if the connection could not be established. Leading to a memory leak.
