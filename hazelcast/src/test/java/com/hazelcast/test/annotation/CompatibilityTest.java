/**
 * Mark a test as a compatibility test, suitable to be executed on a cluster with mixed Hazelcast versions.
 * To actually perform a compatibility test, you need to start test execution with system property
 * "hazelcast.test.compatibility=true".
 * <p>When executing a compatibility test, there are limitations, the most important being:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Only use public API. Code that relies on Hazelcast internals, like obtaining a reference to the {@code Node}
 * in a {@code HazelcastInstance}, will only succeed when executed on a {@code HazelcastInstance} of the current
 * version.</li>
 * <li>Test classes used as domain classes, listeners, entry processors etc, when implementing {@code Serializable}
 * must specify a {@code serialVersionUID}, otherwise failures in serialization/deserialization will occur.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
