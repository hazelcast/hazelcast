/**
 * JUnit rule for testing behavior of cluster while members bounce (shutdown & startup). Key concepts:
 * <ul>
 * <li>BounceMemberRule sets up a cluster before the test's {@code @Before} methods are executed and tears
 * it down after its {@code @After} methods. One member of the cluster is kept running for the duration of
 * the test, while other members are shutdown and replaced by new instances. For example, if the
 * BounceMemberRule is configured to setup a cluster of 5 members, one will stay up while the rest 4 will
 * be shutting down and replaced by new ones while the test tasks are executed. Use
 * {@link #getSteadyMember()} to obtain a reference to the member that is always up.<br>
 * <b>Defaults: </b>cluster size 6 members<br>
 * <b>Configuration: </b>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Cluster members configuration must be provided in {@link BounceMemberRule#with(Config)} which
 * returns a {@link Builder} to obtain a configured {@code BounceMemberRule}</li>
 * <li>Set cluster size with {@link Builder#clusterSize(int)}</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * <li>BounceMemberRule also initializes {@code HazelcastInstance}s to be used as test drivers. References
 * to test drivers can be obtained by invoking {@link #getNextTestDriver()}. Choices for test drivers
 * include:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code ALWAYS_UP_MEMBER}: use as test driver the cluster member that is never shutdown during
 * the test.</li>
 * <li>{@code MEMBER}: prepare a set of members, apart from the configured cluster members, to be used
 * as test drivers.</li>
 * <li>{@code CLIENT}: use clients as test drivers</li>
 * </ul>
 * <b>Defaults: </b> when {@code com.hazelcast.client.test.TestHazelcastFactory} is available on the
 * classpath, then defaults to preparing 5 {@code CLIENT} test drivers, otherwise uses
 * {@code MEMBER} as test driver.<br>
 * <b>Configuration: </b>test driver type and count can be configured with the
 * {@link Builder#driverType(DriverType)} and {@link Builder#driverCount(int)} methods. For more control
 * over the configuration of test drivers, you may also specify a {@link DriverFactory} with
 * {@link Builder#driverFactory(DriverFactory)}.</li>
 * <li>The test case can be directly coded in your {@code @Test} methods, as with regular tests.
 * Alternatively, {@code Runnable}s can be submitted for concurrent execution in a fixed thread pool
 * initialized with as many threads as the number of {@code Runnable}s submitted:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #testRepeatedly(int, Runnable, long)} submits the given {@code Runnable} to be executed
 * with the given number of concurrent threads. The submitted {@code Runnable} must be thread safe.
 * The {@code Runnable} is executed repeatedly until either the configured duration in seconds has
 * passed or its execution throws a {@code Throwable}, in which case the test is failed and the
 * exception is rethrown.</li>
 * <li>{@link #testRepeatedly(Runnable[], long)} same as above, however instead of submitting the same
 * {@code Runnable} to several threads, submits an array of {@code Runnable}s, allowing for concurrent
 * execution of heterogeneous {@code Runnable}s (e.g. several producers & consumers in an
 * {@code ITopic} test). {@code Runnable}s do not have to be thread-safe in this case.</li>
 * <li>{@link #test(Runnable[])} submits an array of {@code Runnable}s to be executed concurrently and
 * blocks until all {@code Runnable}s have been completed. If an exception was thrown during a
 * {@code Runnable}'s execution, the test will fail.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * For examples on how to use this rule, see {@code BounceMemberRuleTest} and {@code QueryBounceTest}.
 * <p>
 * {@code BounceMemberRule} integrates with test lifecycle as described below:
 * <ol>
 * <li>{@code BounceMemberRule} creates the cluster and test drivers</li>
 * <li>the test's {@code @Before} method(s) are executed to prepare the test. Use
 * {@link #getSteadyMember()} to obtain the {@code HazelcastInstace} that is kept running during the test
 * and prepare the test's environment.</li>
 * <li>{@code BounceMemberRule} spawns a separate thread that starts bouncing cluster members</li>
 * <li>the {@code @Test} method is executed</li>
 * <li>{@code BounceMemberRule} stops bouncing cluster members</li>
 * <li>the test's {@code @After} methods are executed</li>
 * <li>{@code BounceMemberRule} tears down test drivers and cluster members</li>
 * </ol>
