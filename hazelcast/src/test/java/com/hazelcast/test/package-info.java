/**
 * Test execution parallelism is achieved at two levels:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Tests with the {@link com.hazelcast.test.annotation.ParallelJVMTest ParallelJVMTest}
 *     category are picked up by surefire plugin for execution in multiple JVMs in parallel.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>Tests whose methods can be executed concurrently by multiple threads within the
 *     same JVM should be executed with the {@link com.hazelcast.test.HazelcastParallelClassRunner}.
 *     Parameterized tests should use the {@link com.hazelcast.test.HazelcastParallelParametersRunnerFactory}
 *     for multithreaded execution. Enterprise counterparts exist for use in Hazelcast Enterprise tests.
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
