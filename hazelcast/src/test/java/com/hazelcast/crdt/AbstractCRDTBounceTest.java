/**
 * Base test class for testing CRDT thread safety and replication behaviour.
 * The test will spawn up to {@value CONCURRENCY} threads that will perform
 * mutation on the provided hazelcast instance and it will additionally
 * "bounce" the hazelcast instances. This means that it rotates through the
 * instance collection, shutting down members and replacing them with new
 * ones.
 * The mutation action may not be applied as the mutation action may
 * provide an instance which is shutting down to the
 * {@link #mutate(HazelcastInstance)} method. The method does not need to
 * concern with exceptions thrown because of this - this is handled by
 * this class as well.
 * <p>
 * This should test that the strong consistency property of the CRDT holds
 * under concurrent mutation and instance shutdown.
