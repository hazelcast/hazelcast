package com.hazelcast.spi;

/**
 * An interface that can be implemented by SPI services to get notified of partition changes; for example, if a
 * {@link com.hazelcast.map.impl.MapService} starts moving its data around because partitions are moving
 * to a different machine.
 * <p>
 * Service itself must decide to keep or remove its data for specific partition according to number of backups
 * it's willing to keep and {@code PartitionMigrationEvent} parameters; partitionId, migration-endpoint,
 * current replica index and new replica index.
 * <ul>
 * <li>Migration endpoint shows which endpoint this member is; either {@code SOURCE} or {@code DESTINATION} </li>
 * <li>Current replica index denotes the replica index which is currently owned by this member before migration.</li>
 * <li>New replica index denotes the replica index which will be owned by this member after migration.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * On migration source, partition replica will be either removed completely or shifted down to a higher indexed replica.
 * During commit, service should remove either all or some part of its data in this partition
 * and run any other action needed. A sample commit on source will look like;
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * public void commitMigration(PartitionMigrationEvent event) {
 *     if (event.getMigrationEndpoint() == MigrationEndpoint.SOURCE) {
 *         if (event.getNewReplicaIndex() == -1 || event.getNewReplicaIndex() > configuredBackupCount) {
 *             // remove data...
 *         }
 *     }
 *     // run any other task needed
 * }
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 * During rollback, source usually doesn't expected to perform any task. But service implementation may need
 * to execute custom tasks.
 * <p>
 * On migration destination, either a fresh partition replica will be received or current replica will be
 * shifted up to a lower indexed replica.
 * During rollback, service should remove either all or some part of its data in this partition
 * and run any other action needed. A sample rollback on destination will look like;
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * public void rollbackMigration(PartitionMigrationEvent event) {
 *      if (event.getMigrationEndpoint() == MigrationEndpoint.DESTINATION) {
 *          if (event.getCurrentReplicaIndex() == -1 || event.getCurrentReplicaIndex() > configuredBackupCount) {
 *              // remove data...
 *          }
 *      }
 *     // run any other task needed
 * }
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * During commit, destination usually doesn't expected to perform any task. But service implementation may need
 * to execute custom tasks.
