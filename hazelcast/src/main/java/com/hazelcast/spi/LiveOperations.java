/**

 *
 * The Trace is not thread-safe and is recycled.
 *
 * This data-structure can be optimized to not generate less litter. Instead of using an ArrayList for Long objects,
 * use an array for primitive longs. Also the lists don't need to be recreated for every time the
 * {@link LiveOperationsTracker#populate(LiveOperations)} method is called; they could be recycled. This would be easy
 * to do since the {@link LiveOperations} is not used by a single thread.
