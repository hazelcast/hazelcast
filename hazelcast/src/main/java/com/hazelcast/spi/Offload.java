/**
 * This is an internal class. So if you are a regular Hazelcast user, you don't
 * want to use this class. You probably want to use
 * {@link com.hazelcast.core.Offloadable}.
 *
 * The Offload is a {@link CallStatus} designed when an offloaded operation
 * needs to offload the processing of the operation to a different system, e.g
 * a different thread and at some point in the future a response will be ready.
 * Offload instance can be created by Operations that require offloading, for
 * more information see the {@link Operation#call()}.
 *
 * If the operation 'offloads' some work, but doesn't send a response ever,
 * {@link CallStatus#DONE_VOID} should be used instead.
 *
 * <h1>Response handling</h1>
 * When the {@link Offload#init(NodeEngineImpl, Set)} is called, the original
 * {@link OperationResponseHandler} of the offloaded operation is decorated with
 * one of designed for the offloading (see heartbeats for more info). This means
 * that sending a response for an offloaded operation, can be done using the
 * regular response handling mechanism
 * (see {@link Operation#sendResponse(Object)} or
 * {@link Operation#getOperationResponseHandler()}. But one should not modify
 * the response handler of an offloaded Operation because otherwise one could
 * e.g. run into a memory leak (the offloaded operation will not be removed
 * from the asynchronous operations).
 *
 * There is an important difference with exception handling. With regular
 * operation when an exception is thrown, first the
 * {@link Operation#onExecutionFailure(Throwable)} is called before the
 * {@link Operation#sendResponse(Object)} is called. But with an offloaded
 * operation, typically the {@link Operation#sendResponse(Object)} is called by
 * the implementation of the offloading logic. So if you need the
 * {@link Operation#onExecutionFailure(Throwable)} to be executed, just as the
 * sendResponse call, the onExecuteFailure call is your own concern.
 *
 * <h1>Heartbeats</h1>
 * The Offload functionality automatically registers the offloaded operation for
 * operation heartbeats. The registration is done when the
 * {@link Offload#init(NodeEngineImpl, Set)} is called. And it is unregistered,
 * as soon as a response is send to the offloaded operation. This is done by
 * decorating updating the original response handler of the operation by wrapping
 * it in a decorating response handler that automatically deregisters on completion.
