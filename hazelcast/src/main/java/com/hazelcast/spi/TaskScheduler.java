/**
 * {@link ExecutorService} can schedule a command to run after a given delay or execute periodically.
 *
 * The {@link #scheduleWithRepetition(Runnable, long, long, TimeUnit)} has similar semantic
 * to {@link java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService#scheduleAtFixedRate(Runnable, long, long, TimeUnit)}. It
 * guarantees a task won't be executed by multiple threads concurrently. The difference is that this service will
 * skip a scheduled execution if another thread is still running the same task, instead of postponing its execution.
 * To emphasize this difference the method is called <code>scheduleAtFixedRate</code>
 * instead of <code>scheduleAtFixedRate</code>
 *
 * The other difference is this service does not offer an equivalent of
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService#scheduleWithFixedDelay(Runnable, long, long, TimeUnit)}
