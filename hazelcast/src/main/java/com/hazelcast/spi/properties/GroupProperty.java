     * means that all entries need to have the hash calculated before being stored in a bucket.
     * Each index-write operation however will be fast, since there will be no copying taking place.
     *
     * -> Copying on-write means that each index-write operation will completely copy the underlying map to provide the
     * copy-on-write semantics. Depending on the index size, it may be a very expensive operation.
     * Each index-read operation will be very fast, however, since it may just access the map and return it to the caller.
     *
     * -> Never copying is tricky. It means that the internal data structures of the index are concurrently modified without
     * copy-on-write semantics. Index reads never copy the results of a query to a separate map.
     * It means that the results backed by the underlying index-map can change after the query has been executed.
     * Specifically an entry might have been added / removed from an index, or it might have been remapped.
     * Should be used in cases when a the caller expects "mostly correct" results - specifically, if it's ok
     * if some entries returned in the result set do not match the initial query criteria.
     * The fastest solution for read and writes, since no copying takes place.

     * <li>COPY_ON_WRITE - Internal data structures of the index are modified with copy-on-write semantics.

     * In Java 6 there is no out-of-the-box support for removal of cancelled tasks,

     * By default tasks are removed, because it can lead to temporary retention
     * of memory if there a large volume of pending cancelled tasks. And this can
     * lead to gc/performance problems as we saw with the transaction tests.
     *
     * However if this automatic removal of cancelled tasks start to become a
     * performance problem, it can be disabled in Java 6.
