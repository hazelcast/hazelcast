/**
 * <p>A <tt>PartitionGroupStrategy</tt> implementation defines a strategy
 * how backup groups are designed. Backup groups are units containing
 * one or more Hazelcast nodes to share the same physical host, rack or
 * zone and backups are stored on nodes being part of a different
 * backup group. This behavior builds an additional layer of data
 * reliability by making sure that, in case of two racks, if rack A
 * fails, rack B will still have all the backups and is guaranteed
 * to still provide all data. Similar is true for zones or physical hosts.</p>
 * <p>Custom implementations of the PartitionGroupStrategy may add specific
 * or additional behavior based on the provided environment and can
 * be injected into Hazelcast by overriding
 * {@link AbstractDiscoveryStrategy#getPartitionGroupStrategy()}.</p>
