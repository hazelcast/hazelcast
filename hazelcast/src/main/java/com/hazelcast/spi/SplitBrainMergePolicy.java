     * <p>
     * The keys and values of merging and existing {@link SplitBrainMergeEntryView}s are always in the in-memory format of the
     * backing data structure. This can be a serialized format, so the content cannot be processed without deserialization.
     * For most merge policies this will be fine, since the key or value are not used. If your implementation needs the
     * deserialized data, you can use {@link SerializationService#toObject(Object)} of the injected SerializationService.
     * <p>
     * The deserialization is not done eagerly for two main reasons:
     * <ul>
     * <li>The deserialization is quite expensive and should be avoided, if the result is not needed.</li>
     * <li>There is no need to locate classes of stored entries on the server side, when the entries are not deserialized.
     * So you can put entries from a client by using {@link com.hazelcast.config.InMemoryFormat#BINARY} with a different
     * classpath on client and server. In this case a deserialization could throw a {@link java.lang.ClassNotFoundException}.</li>
     * </ul>
