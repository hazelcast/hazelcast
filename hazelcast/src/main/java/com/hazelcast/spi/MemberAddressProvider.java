/**
 * <b>IMPORTANT</b>
 * This interface is not intended to provide addresses of other cluster members with
 * which the hazelcast instance will form a cluster. This is an SPI for advanced use in
 * cases where the {@link com.hazelcast.instance.DefaultAddressPicker} does not
 * pick suitable addresses to bind to and publish to other cluster members.
 * For instance, this could allow easier deployment in some cases when running on
 * Docker, AWS or other cloud environments.
 *
 * That said, if you are just starting with Hazelcast, you will probably want to
 * set the member addresses by using {@link com.hazelcast.config.TcpIpConfig#setMembers(List)},
 * {@link com.hazelcast.config.MulticastConfig} or adding a discovery strategy.
 *
 * Allow to customize:
 * 1. What address Hazelcast will bind to
 * 2. What address Hazelcast will advertise to other members on which they can bind to
 * <p>
 * This is practical in some cloud environments where the default strategy is not yielding good results.
 *
