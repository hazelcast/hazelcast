/**
 * An interface that can be implemented by an operation to indicate that is should
 * be invoked on a particular partition.
 *
 * This interface only has means for documentation purposes. Because every operation has a {@link Operation#getPartitionId()}
 * method, the system will use that to determine if an Operation is partition-aware. So the system is fine if you create
 * an Operation that doesn't implements PartitionAwareOperation, but returns a partitionId equal or larger than 0 (and therefor is
 * partition-specific). But it is also fine if you do implement this PartitionAwareOperation interface, and return -1 as
 * partition ID (and therefor is not specific to a partition).
