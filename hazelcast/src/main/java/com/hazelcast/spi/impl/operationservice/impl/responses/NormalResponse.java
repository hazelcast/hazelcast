/**
 * A NormalResponse is send when an Operation needs to return a value. This response value can a 'normal' value,
 * but it can also contain the exception thrown.
 * <p/>
 * Currently there is a limitation in the design that needs to be dealt with in the future: there is no distinction
 * made between an exception thrown or an exception returned as a regular value. In such a case, Hazelcast will
 * always rethrow the exception.
 * <p/>
 * The NormalResponse contains the actual 'value' but also the callid of that operation
 * and the backup count. Based on the backup count, the invoker of the operation
 * knows when all the backups have completed.
