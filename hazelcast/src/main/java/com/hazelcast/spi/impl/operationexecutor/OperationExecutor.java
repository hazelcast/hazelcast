/**
 * The OperationExecutor is responsible for scheduling work (packets/operations) to be executed. It can be compared
 * to a {@link java.util.concurrent.Executor} with the big difference that it is designed for assigning packets,
 * operations and PartitionSpecificRunnable to a thread instead of only runnables.
 *
 * It depends on the implementation if an operation is executed on the calling thread or not. For example the
 * {@link OperationExecutorImpl} will always offload a partition specific
 * Operation to the correct partition-operation-thread.
 *
 * The actual processing of a operation-packet, Operation, or a PartitionSpecificRunnable is forwarded to the
 * {@link OperationRunner}.
