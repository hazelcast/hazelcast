/**
 * A {@link CallIdSequence} that provides backpressure by taking
 * the number of in-flight operations into account when before creating a new call-id.
 * <p>
 * It is possible to temporarily create more concurrent invocations than the declared capacity due to:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>system operations</li>
 *     <li>the racy nature of checking if space is available and getting the next sequence. </li>
 * </ul>
 * The latter cause is not a problem since the capacity is exceeded temporarily and it isn't sustainable.
 * So perhaps there are a few threads that at the same time see that the there is space and do a next.
