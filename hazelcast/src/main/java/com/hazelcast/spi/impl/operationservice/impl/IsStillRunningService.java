 * Checks if an Operation is still running. This is useful when an operation isn't executed (e.g. got lost due to an
 * OOME on the remote side) and no response is ever send.
 *
 * The behavior needs to be cleaned up.
 *
 * Currently we only detect if an operation is actually running, not if it is in a queue somewhere. So it can mean that you
 * assume an operation isn't running, even though it is queued. Another issue is that the actual IsStillRunningOperation
 * isn't executed quick enough and then the system still decides that the operation isn't running.
 *
 * Instead of letting every invocation ask the remote system if an operation is still running, let the remote system
 * send a batch of all the call-id's for a particular member of the operations that are running.
