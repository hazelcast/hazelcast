/**
 * The AsyncResponsePacketHandler is a PacketHandler that asynchronously process operation-response packets.
 * <p/>
 * So when a response is received from a remote system, it is put in the workQueue of the ResponseThread.
 * Then the ResponseThread takes it from this workQueue and calls the {@link PacketHandler} for the
 * actual processing.
 * <p/>
 * The reason that the IO thread doesn't immediately deals with the response is that deserializing the
 * {@link com.hazelcast.spi.impl.operationservice.impl.responses.Response} and let the invocation-future
 * deal with the response can be rather expensive currently.
