/**
 * Responsible for generating callIds.
 * <p/>
 * It is very important that for each {@link #next(Invocation)}, there is a matching {@link #complete(Invocation)}.
 * If this doesn't match, than either the number of concurrent invocations can grow or shrink over time. This can lead
 * to OOME or deadlock.
 * <p/>
 * The CallIdSequence provides back pressure if enabled and there are too many concurrent invocations. When this happens,
 * an exponential backoff policy is applied.
 * <p/>
 * Currently a single CallIdSequence is used for all partitions; so there is contention. Also one partition can cause problems
 * in other partition if a lot of invocations are created for that partition. Then other partitions can't make as many invocations
 * because a single callIdSequence is being used.
 * <p/>
 * In the future we could add a CallIdSequence per partition or using some 'concurrency level' and do a mod based on the
 * partition-id. The advantage is that you reduce contention and improved isolation, at the expensive of:
 * <ol>
 * <li>increased complexity</li>
 * <li>not always being able to fully utilize the number of invocations.</li>
 * </ol>
