/**
 * Contains primitives needed to compute an aggregated result of data
 * processing. Check out {@link AggregateOperations} to find the one
 * you need and, if you don't find it there, construct one by using the
 * {@link #withCreate aggregate operation builder} and reading the
 * description below.
 * <p>
 * Jet aggregates the data by updating a mutable container,
 * called the <em>accumulator</em>, with the data from each stream item.
 * It does this by applying the {@link #accumulateFn accumulate} primitive
 * to the the accumulator and a given item. Jet provides some accumulator
 * objects in the {@link com.hazelcast.jet.accumulator accumulator} package
 * that you can reuse, and you can also write your own if needed. The
 * accumulator must be serializable because Jet may need to send it to
 * another member to be combined with other accumulators or store it in state
 * snapshot.
 * <p>
 * After it processes all the items in a batch/window, Jet transforms the
 * accumulator into the final result by applying the {@link #finishFn()
 * finish} primitive.
 * <p>
 * Since it is a distributed/parallel computation engine, Jet will create
 * several independent processing units to perform the same aggregation,
 * and it must combine their partial results before applying the {@code
 * finish} primitive and emitting the final result. This is the role of the
 * {@link #combineFn combine} primitive.
 * <p>
 * Finally, {@code AggregateOperation} also defines the {@link #deductFn()
 * deduct} primitive, which allows Jet to efficiently aggregate infinite
 * stream data into a <em>sliding window</em> by evicting old data from the
 * existing accumulator instead of building a new one from scratch each time
 * the window slides forward. Providing a {@code deduct} primitive that makes
 * the computation more efficient than rebuilding the accumulator from scratch
 * isn't always possible. Therefore it is optional.
 * <p>
 * Depending on usage, the data items may come from one or more inbound
 * streams, and the {@code AggregateOperation} must provide a separate
 * {@code accumulate} primitive for each of them. If you are creating the
 * aggregating pipeline stage using the {@link StageWithKeyAndWindow#aggregateBuilder
 * builder object}, then you'll identify each contributing stream to the
 * {@code AggregateOperation} using the <em>tags</em> you got from the
 * builder.
 * <p>
 * If, on the other hand, you are calling one of the direct methods such
 * as {@link StageWithKeyAndWindow#aggregate2
 * stage.aggregate2()}, then you'll deal with specializations of this interface
 * such as {@link AggregateOperation2} and you'll identify the input stages by
 * their index; zero index corresponds to the stage you're calling the
 * method on and the higher indices correspond to the stages you pass in as
 * arguments.
 * <p>
 * This is a summary of all the primitives involved:
 * <ol><li>
 *     {@link #createFn() create} a new accumulator object
 * </li><li>
 *     {@link #accumulateFn(Tag) accumulate} the data of an item by mutating
 *     the accumulator
 * </li><li>
 *     {@link #combineFn() combine} the contents of the right-hand
 *     accumulator into the left-hand one, optional
 * </li><li>
 *     {@link #deductFn() deduct} the contents of the right-hand accumulator
 *     from the left-hand one (undo the effects of {@code combine}), optional
 * </li><li>
 *     {@link #exportFn() export}: calculate the result value from an
 *     accumulator while preserving the accumulator state for further
 *     accumulation. Used for aggregations with speculative results or for
 *     rolling aggregations
 * </li><li>
 *     {@link #finishFn() finish}: calculate the result value from an
 *     accumulator. After this conversion the accumulator will no longer be
 *     used, it's allowed, for example, to use the {@code identity()} function
 * </li></ol>
 *
 * All the functions must be stateless and {@linkplain
 * Processor#isCooperative() cooperative}.
 *
 * @param <A> the type of the accumulator
 * @param <R> the type of the final result
 *
 * @since 3.0
