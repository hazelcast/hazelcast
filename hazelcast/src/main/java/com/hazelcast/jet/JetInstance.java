     * releases.
     * <p>
     * Hazelcast can execute SQL statements using either the default SQL
     * backend contained in the Hazelcast IMDG code, or using the Jet SQL
     * backend in this package. The algorithm is this: we first try the
     * default backend, if it can't execute a particular statement, we try the
     * Jet backend.
     * <p>
     * For proper functionality the {@code hazelcast-jet-sql.jar} has to be on
     * the class path.
     * <p>
     * The text below summarizes Hazelcast Jet SQL features. For a summary of
     * the default SQL engine features, see the {@linkplain SqlService
     * superclass} documentation.
     *
     * <h1>Overview</h1>
     *
     * Hazelcast Jet is able to execute distributed SQL statements over any Jet
     * connector that supports the SQL integration. Currently those are:
     *
     * <ul>
     *     <li>local IMaps (writing only)
     *     <li>Apache Kafka topics
     *     <li>Files (local and remote, reading only)
     * </ul>
     *
     * Each connector specifies its own serialization formats and a way of
     * mapping the stored objects to records with column names and SQL types.
     * See the individual connectors for details.
     * <p>
     * In the first release we support a very limited set of features,
     * essentially only reading and writing from/to the above connectors and
     * projection + filtering. Currently these are unsupported: joins,
     * grouping, aggregation. We plan to support these in the future.
     *
     * <h1>Full Documentation</h1>
     *
     * The full documentation of all SQL features is available at <a
     * href='https://jet-start.sh/docs/sql/'>https://jet-start.sh/docs/sql/</a>.
