 * stage, the one whose data will be enriched from all other stages.
 * <p>
 * Collect all the tags returned from {@code add()} and use them to retrieve
 * the enriching items from {@link ItemsByTag} you get in the result.
 * <p>
 * This object is mainly intended to build a hash-join of the primary stage
 * with three or more contributing stages. For one or two stages, prefer the
 * direct {@code stage.hashJoin(...)} calls because they offer more static
 * type safety.
