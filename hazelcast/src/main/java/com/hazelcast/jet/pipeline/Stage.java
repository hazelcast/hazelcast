/**
 * The basic element of a Jet {@link Pipeline pipeline}, represents
 * a computation step. It accepts input from its upstream stages (if any)
 * and passes its output to its downstream stages (if any). Jet
 * differentiates between {@link BatchStage batch stages} that represent
 * finite data sets (batches) and {@link StreamStage stream stages} that
 * represent infinite data streams. Some operations only make sense on a
 * batch stage and vice versa.
 * <p>
 * To build a pipeline, start with {@link Pipeline#readFrom pipeline.readFrom()} to
 * get the initial stage and then use its methods to attach further
 * downstream stages. Terminate the pipeline by calling {@link
 * GeneralStage#writeTo(Sink) stage.writeTo(sink)}, which will attach a
 * {@link SinkStage}.
