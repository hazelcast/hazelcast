/**
 * A holder of functions needed to create and destroy a service object used in
 * pipeline transforms such as {@link GeneralStage#mapUsingService
 * stage.mapUsingService()}.
 * <p>
 * The lifecycle of this factory object is as follows:
 * <ol><li>
 *     When you submit a job, Jet serializes {@code ServiceFactory} and sends
 *     it to all the cluster members.
 * <li>
 *     On each member Jet calls {@link #createContextFn()} to get a context
 *     object that will be shared across all the service instances on that
 *     member. For example, if you are connecting to an external service that
 *     provides a thread-safe client, you can create it here and then create
 *     individual sessions for each service instance.
 * <li>
 *     Jet repeatedly calls {@link #createServiceFn()} to create as many
 *     service instances on each member as determined by the {@link
 *     GeneralStage#setLocalParallelism(int) localParallelism} of the pipeline
 *     stage. The invocations of {@link #createServiceFn()} receive the context
 *     object.
 *  <li>
 *      When the job is done, Jet calls {@link #destroyServiceFn()} with each
 *      service instance.
 *  <li>
 *      Finally, Jet calls {@link #destroyContextFn()} with the context object.
 * </ol>
 * If you don't need the member-wide context object, you can call the simpler
 * methods {@link ServiceFactories#nonSharedService(FunctionEx, ConsumerEx)}
 * ServiceFactories.processorLocalService} or {@link
 * ServiceFactories#sharedService(FunctionEx, ConsumerEx)}
 * ServiceFactories.memberLocalService}.
 * <p>
 * Here's a list of pipeline transforms that require a {@code ServiceFactory}:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link GeneralStage#mapUsingService}
 *     <li>{@link GeneralStage#filterUsingService}
 *     <li>{@link GeneralStage#flatMapUsingService}
 *     <li>{@link GeneralStage#mapUsingServiceAsync}
 *     <li>{@link GeneralStage#mapUsingServiceAsyncBatched}
 *     <li>{@link GeneralStageWithKey#mapUsingService}
 *     <li>{@link GeneralStageWithKey#filterUsingService}
 *     <li>{@link GeneralStageWithKey#flatMapUsingService}
 *     <li>{@link GeneralStageWithKey#mapUsingServiceAsync}
 * </ul>
