/**
 * When Jet executes a DAG, it creates one or more instances of {@code
 * Processor} on each cluster member to do the work of a given vertex. The
 * vertex's {@code localParallelism} property controls the number of
 * processors per member.
 * <p>
 * The processor is a single-threaded processing unit that performs the
 * computation needed to transform zero or more input data streams into
 * zero or more output streams. Each input/output stream corresponds to
 * an edge on the vertex. The correspondence between a stream and an
 * edge is established via the edge's <em>ordinal</em>.
 * <p>
 * The special case of zero input streams applies to a <em>source</em>
 * vertex, which gets its data from the environment. The special case of
 * zero output streams applies to a <em>sink</em> vertex, which pushes its
 * data to the environment.
 * <p>
 * The processor accepts input from instances of {@link Inbox} and pushes
 * its output to an instance of {@link Outbox}.
 * <p>
 * See the {@link #isCooperative()} for important restrictions to how the
 * processor should work.
 *
 * <h3>Processing methods</h3>
 *
 * When the documentation in this class refers to <em>processing methods,</em>
 * we mean all methods except for these:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link #isCooperative()}
 *     <li>{@link #init(Outbox, Context)}
 *     <li>{@link #close()}
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Transactional processors</h3>
 *
 * If this processor communicates with an external transactional store, after
 * the snapshot is restored and before it executes any code in a <em>processing
 * method</em>, it should rollback all transactions that this processor
 * created. It should only rollback transactions created by this vertex and
 * this job; it can use the vertex name and job ID passed to the {@link #init}
 * method in the context to filter.
 * <p>
 * <b>Determining the list of transactions to rollback</b><br/>
 * You can't store the IDs of the created transactions to the snapshot, as one
 * might intuitively think. The job might run for a while after creating a
 * snapshot and start a new transaction and we need to roll that one too. The
 * job might even fail before it creates the first snapshot.
 * <p>
 * There are multiple ways to tackle this:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>enumerate all pending transactions in the external system and
 *     rollback those that were created by this processor. For example, a file
 *     sink can list files in the directory it is writing to
 *
 *     <li>if the remote system doesn't allow us to enumerate transactions,
 *     we can use deterministic scheme for transaction ID and probe all IDs
 *     that could be used by this processor. For example: {@code jobId +
 *     vertexId + globalProcessorIndex + sequence}
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>How the methods are called</h3>
 *
 * Besides {@link #init}, {@link #close} and {@link #isCooperative} the methods
 * are called in a tight loop with a possibly short back-off if the method does
 * no work. "No work" is defined as adding nothing to outbox and taking nothing
 * from inbox. If you do heavy work on each call (such as querying a remote
 * service), you can do additional back-off: use {@code sleep} in a
 * non-cooperative processor or do nothing if sufficient time didn't elapse.
 *
 * @since 3.0

     * multithreading. If this processor declares itself cooperative, it will
     * share a thread with other cooperative processors. Otherwise it will run
     * in a dedicated Java thread.
     * <p>
     * There are specific requirements that all <em>processing methods</em> of
     * a cooperative processor must follow:
     * <ul>
     *     <li>each call must take a reasonably small amount of time (up to a
     *     millisecond). Violations will manifest as increased latency due to
     *     slower switching of processors.
     *
     *     <li>should also not attempt any blocking operations, such as I/O
     *     operations, waiting for locks/semaphores or sleep operations.
     *     Violations of this rule will manifest as less than 100% CPU usage
     *     under maximum load (note that this is possible for other reasons
     *     too, for example if the network is the bottleneck or if {@linkplain
     *     JetProperties#JET_IDLE_COOPERATIVE_MAX_MICROSECONDS parking time} is
     *     too high). The processor must also return as soon as the outbox
     *     rejects an item (that is when the {@link Outbox#offer(Object)
     *     offer()} method returns {@code false}).
     * </ul>
     *
     * Non-cooperative processors are allowed to block, but still must return
     * at least once per second (that is, they should not block
     * indeterminately). If they block longer, snapshots will take longer to
     * complete and job will respond more slowly to termination: Jet doesn't
     * interrupt the dedicated threads if it wants them to cancel, it waits for
     * them to return.
     * <p>
     * Jet prefers cooperative processors because they result in a greater
     * overall throughput. A processor should be non-cooperative only if it
     * involves blocking operations, which would cause all other processors on
     * the same shared thread to starve.
     * <p>
     * Processor instances of a single vertex are allowed to return different
     * values, but a single processor instance must always return the same value.
