/**
 * Data sink for a {@link Processor}. The outbox consists of individual
 * output buckets, one per outbound edge of the vertex represented by the
 * associated processor and one for the snapshot state. The processor must
 * deliver its output items separated by destination edge into the outbox
 * by calling {@link #offer(int, Object)} or {@link #offer(Object)}.
 * <p>
 * To save its current state to the snapshot, it must call {@link
 * #offerToSnapshot(Object, Object)} from its implementation of {@link
 * Processor#saveToSnapshot() saveToSnapshot()}.
 * <p>
 * The outbox has finite capacity and will eventually refuse an item. If
 * one of the {@code offer()} methods returns {@code false}, the calling
 * processor must return from its callback method and retry delivering the
 * same item when Jet calls its method again.
 *
 * <h4>Thread safety</h4>
 * You must offer to outbox only from the thread that called the processor's
 * methods. For example, you must not offer to outbox from a callback of an
 * asynchronous operation. If you need that, you have to employ a concurrent
 * queue, add to it in the callback and drain it in e.g. {@link
 * Processor#tryProcess()}.
