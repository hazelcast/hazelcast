/**
 * Base class to implement custom processors. Simplifies the contract of
 * {@code Processor} with several levels of convenience:
 * <ol><li>
 *     {@link Processor#init(Outbox, Context)} retains the supplied outbox
 *     and the logger retrieved from the context.
 * </li><li>
 *     {@link #process(int, Inbox) process(n, inbox)} delegates to the matching
 *     {@code tryProcessN()} with each item received in the inbox.
 * </li><li>
 *     There is also the general {@link #tryProcess(int, Object)} to which
 *     the {@code tryProcessN} methods delegate by default. It is convenient
 *     to override it when the processor doesn't care which edge an item
 *     originates from. Another convenient idiom is to override {@code
 *     tryProcessN()} for one or two specially treated edges and override
 *     {@link #tryProcess(int, Object)} to process the rest of the edges, which
 *     are treated uniformly.
 * </li><li>
 *     The {@code tryEmit(...)} methods avoid the need to deal with {@code Outbox}
 *     directly.
 * </li><li>
 *     The {@code emitFromTraverser(...)} methods handle the boilerplate of
 *     emission from a traverser. They are especially useful in the
 *     {@link #complete()} step when there is a collection of items to emit.
 *     The {@link Traversers} class contains traversers tailored to simplify
 *     the implementation of {@code complete()}.
 * </li><li>
 *     The {@link FlatMapper FlatMapper} class additionally simplifies the
 *     usage of {@code emitFromTraverser()} inside {@code tryProcess()}, in
 *     a scenario where an input item results in a collection of output
 *     items. {@code FlatMapper} is obtained from one of the factory methods
 *     {@link #flatMapper(Function) flatMapper(...)}.
