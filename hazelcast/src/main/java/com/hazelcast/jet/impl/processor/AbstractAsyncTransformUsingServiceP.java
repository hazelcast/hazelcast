     * <li>
     *     <b>Unordered:</b> results of the async calls are emitted as they
     *     arrive. This mode is enabled by this method.
     * </ol>
     * The unordered mode can be faster:
     * <ul><li>
     *     in the ordered mode, one stalling call will block all subsequent items,
     *     even though responses for them were already received
     * <li>
     *     to preserve the order after a restart, the ordered implementation when
     *     saving the state to the snapshot waits for all async calls to complete.
     *     This creates a hiccup depending on the async call latency. The unordered
     *     one saves in-flight items to the state snapshot.
     * </ul>
     * The order of watermarks is preserved even in the unordered mode. Jet
     * forwards the watermark after having emitted all the results of the items
     * that came before it. One stalling response will prevent a windowed
     * operation downstream from finishing, but if the operation is configured
     * to emit early results, they will be more correct with the unordered
     * approach.
