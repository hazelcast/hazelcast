 * An exception thrown when the cluster size is below the defined threshold.

 * It does NOT refer to an implementation of Paxos or Raft protocols as used in many NoSQL and distributed systems.
 * The mechanism it provides in Hazelcast protects the user in case the number of nodes in a cluster drops below the
