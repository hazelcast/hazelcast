/**
 * <p>This package contains ISemaphore functionality for Hazelcast.<br/>
 * The ISemaphore is the distributed version of the {@link java.util.concurrent.Semaphore}.
 *
 * Unfortunately the j.u.c.Semaphore doesn't expose an interface, so the ISemaphore copies most of the
 * method and unlike the {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock} the {@link com.hazelcast.core.ISemaphore}
 * is not a drop in replacement for the {@link java.util.concurrent.Semaphore}.
