/**
 * {@code ICacheManager} is the entry point to access JSR-107 (JCache) caches via {@link HazelcastInstance} interface.
 * Hazelcast's {@code ICacheManager} provides access to JCache caches configured cluster-wide, even when created by different
 * JCache {@link javax.cache.CacheManager}s.
 *
 * <p>Note that this interface is not related to JCache {@link javax.cache.CacheManager}. Its purpose is to host
 * {@code ICache} related methods, separately from {@link HazelcastInstance}, in order to allow frameworks that make
 * use of reflection and/or dynamic proxies (e.g. Mockito, Spring etc) to operate on {@link HazelcastInstance} when JCache
 * is not on the classpath.
 * See also related issue https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8352.
