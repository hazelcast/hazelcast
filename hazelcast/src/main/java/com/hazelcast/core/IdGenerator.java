/**
 * The IdGenerator is responsible for creating unique ids (a {@code long}) in a cluster.
 *
 * In theory a {@link com.hazelcast.core.IAtomicLong#incrementAndGet()} could be used to provide the same functionality.
 * The big difference is that the incrementAndGet requires one or more remote calls for every invocation and therefor
 * is a performance and scalability bottleneck. The IdGenerator uses an IAtomicLong under the hood, but instead of
 * doing remote call for every call to {@link #newId()}, it does it less frequently. It checks out a chunk, e.g. 1..1000 and
 * as long as it has not yet consumed all the ids in its chunk, then no remote call is done.
 *
 * It can be that ids generated by different cluster members will get out of order because each member will get its own chunk. It
 * can be that member 1 has chunk 1..1000 and member 2 has 1001..2000. Therefore, member 2 will automatically have ids that
 * are out of order with the ids generated by member 1.
