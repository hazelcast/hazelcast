/**
 * The Pipelining can be used to speed up requests. It is build on top of asynchronous
 * requests like e.g. {@link IMap#getAsync(Object)} or any other asynchronous call.
 *
 * The main purpose of the Pipelining is to control the number of concurrent requests
 * when using asynchronous invocations. This can be done by setting the depth using
 * the constructor. So you could set the depth to e.g 100 and do 1000 calls. That means
 * that at any given moment, there will only be 100 concurrent requests.
 *
 * It depends on the situation what the optimal depth (number of invocations in
 * flight) should be. If it is too high, you can run into memory related problems.
 * If it is too low, it will provide little or no performance advantage at all. In
 * most cases a Pipelining and a few hundred map/cache puts/gets should not lead to any
 * problems. For testing purposes we frequently have a Pipelining of 1000 or more
 * concurrent requests to be able to saturate the system.
 *
 * The Pipelining can't be used for transaction purposes. So you can't create a
 * Pipelining, add a set of asynchronous request and then not call {@link #results()}
 * to prevent executing these requests. Invocations can be executed before the
 * {@link #results()} is called.
 *
 * Pipelining can be used by both clients or members.
 *
 * The Pipelining isn't threadsafe. So only a single thread should add requests to
 * the Pipelining and wait for results.
 *
 * Currently all {@link ICompletableFuture} and their responses are stored in the
 * Pipelining. So be careful executing a huge number of request with a single Pipelining
 * because it can lead to a huge memory bubble. In this cases it is better to
 * periodically, after waiting for completion, to replace the Pipelining by a new one.
 * In the future we might provide this as an out of the box experience, but currently
 * we do not.
 *
 * A Pipelining provides its own backpressure on the system. So there will not be more
 * in flight invocations than the depth of the Pipelining. This means that the Pipelining
 * will work fine when backpressure on the client/member is disabled (default). Also
 * when it is enabled it will work fine, but keep in mind that the number of concurrent
 * invocations in the Pipelining could be lower than the configured number of invocation
 * of the Pipelining because the backpressure on the client/member is leading.
 *
 * The Pipelining has been marked as Beta since we need to see how the API needs to
 * evolve. But there is no problem using it in production. We use similar techniques
 * to achieve high performance.
