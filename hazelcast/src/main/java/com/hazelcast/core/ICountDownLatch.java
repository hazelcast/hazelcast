/**
 * ICountDownLatch is a backed-up distributed alternative to the
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch}.
 * <p>
 * ICountDownLatch is a cluster-wide synchronization aid
 * that allows one or more threads to wait until a set of operations being
 * performed in other threads completes.
 * <p>
 * There are a few differences compared to the {@link ICountDownLatch}:
 * <ol>
 * <li>
 * the ICountDownLatch count can be reset using {@link #trySetCount(int)} after a countdown
 * has finished but not during an active count. This allows the same latch instance to be reused.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * There is no await() method to do an unbound wait since this is undesirable in a distributed
 * application: for example, a cluster can split or the master and
 * replicas could all die. In most cases, it is best to configure an explicit timeout so you have the ability
 * to deal with these situations.
 * </li>
 * </ol>
 * Behaviour of {@link ICountDownLatch} under split-brain scenarios should be taken into account when using this
 * data structure.  During a split, each partitioned cluster will either create a brand new and uninitialised (zero'd)
 * {@link ICountDownLatch} or it will continue to use the primary or back-up version.  For example
 * it may be possible for both the back-up and primary to be resident in one cluster partition and for another to
 * be created as new in another side.  In any of these cases the counter in the respective {@link ICountDownLatch}
 * may diverge.
 * <p>
 * When the split heals, Hazelcast performs a default largest cluster wins resolution or where clusters sizes are equal
 * a random winner is chosen. This can lead to situations where the {@ICountDown} is left in an unpredictable state,
 * and a countdown to zero may never be achieved.
 * <p>
 * If required, when using {@link ICountDownLatch} as an orchestration mechanism you should assess the state of the
 * orchestration outcome and the associated countdown actors after a split-brain heal has taken place, and take steps to
 * re-orchestrate if appropriate.
 *
 * Supports Quorum {@link com.hazelcast.config.QuorumConfig} since 3.10 in cluster versions 3.10 and higher.
