/**
 * IndeterminateOperationStateException is thrown when result of an invocation becomes indecisive.
 * <p>
 * For instance, an invocation doesn't receive enough ACKs from the backup replicas in time.
 * In this case, IndeterminateOperationStateException only informs the caller that the operation may not be executed
 * on all requested backup replicas, hence durability of the written / updated value may not be guaranteed immediately.
 * This timeout is defined by configuration property {@link ClusterProperty#OPERATION_BACKUP_TIMEOUT_MILLIS}.
 * <p>
 * Similarly, if the member, which owns the primary replica of the operation's target partition, leaves the cluster
 * before a response is returned, then <p>operation is not retried but fails with IndeterminateOperationStateException.
 * However, there will not be any rollback on other successful replicas.
 * <p>
 * Last, if a Raft group leader leaves the cluster before sending a response for the invocation, the invocation may terminate
 * without knowing if the operation is committed or not.
