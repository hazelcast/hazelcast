/**
 * Hazelcast distributed map implementation is an in-memory data store, but
 * it can be backed by any type of data store such as RDBMS, OODBMS, NOSQL, or simply
 * a file-based data store.
 * <p/>
 * IMap.put(key, value) normally stores the entry into JVM's memory. If MapStore
 * implementation is provided then Hazelcast will also call the MapStore
 * implementation to store the entry into a user-defined storage, such as
 * RDBMS or some other external storage system. It is completely up to the user
 * how the key-value will be stored or deleted.
 * <p/>
 * Same goes for IMap.remove(key).
 * <p/>
 * Store implementation can be called synchronously (write-through)
 * or asynchronously (write-behind) depending on the configuration.
