/**
 * Hazelcast provides distribution mechanism for publishing messages that are delivered to multiple subscribers,
 * which is also known as a publish/subscribe (pub/sub) messaging model. Publish and subscriptions are cluster-wide.
 * When a member subscribes for a topic, it is actually registering for messages published by any member in the cluster,
 * including the new members joined after you added the listener.
 * <p>
 * Messages are ordered, meaning that listeners(subscribers)
 * will process the messages in the order they are actually published. If cluster member M publishes messages
 * m1, m2, m3...mn to a topic T, then Hazelcast makes sure that all of the subscribers of topic T will receive
 * and process m1, m2, m3...mn in order.
 * <p>
 * Since Hazelcast 3.5 it is possible to have reliable topics. Normally all topics rely on the a shared eventing system and
 * shared threads. With Hazelcast 3.5 it is possible to configure a topic to be reliable and to gets its own
 * {@link com.hazelcast.ringbuffer.Ringbuffer} to store events and to gets its own executor to process events. The events
 * in the ringbuffer are replicated, so they won't get lost when a node goes down.
