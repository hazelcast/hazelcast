/**
 * ISemaphore is a backed-up distributed implementation of {@link java.util.concurrent.Semaphore java.util.concurrent.Semaphore}.
 * <p/>
 * Hazelcast's ISemaphore is a cluster-wide counting semaphore.  Conceptually,
 * it maintains a set of permits.  Each {@link #acquire()} blocks if necessary until
 * a permit is available, and then takes it.  Each {@link #release()} adds a permit,
 * potentially releasing a blocking acquirer. However, no actual permit objects are
 * used; the semaphore just keeps a count of the number available and acts accordingly.
 * <p/>The Hazelcast distributed semaphore implementation guarantees that
 * threads invoking any of the {@link #acquire() acquire} methods are selected
 * to obtain permits in the order in which their invocation of those methods
 * was processed(first-in-first-out; FIFO).  Note that FIFO ordering necessarily
 * applies to specific internal points of execution within the cluster.  So,
 * it is possible for one member to invoke {@code acquire} before another, but reach
 * the ordering point after the other, and similarly upon return from the method.
 * <p/>The Hazelcast semaphore also allows you to {@link #attach()}/{@link #detach()}
 * permits to the caller address.  This provides a safety mechanism in case
 * that address becomes disconnected from the cluster.  Attached permits will
 * automatically be {@link #release() released} to the semaphore if a disconnection
 * occurs.  An address can also have an excess number of detached permits and is
 * represented by a negative attached permit count.  This is the number of permits
 * that the semaphore will automatically be {@link #reducePermits(int) reduced} by
 * if a disconnection occurs.
 * <p/>This class also provides convenience methods to {@link
 * #acquire(int) acquire} and {@link #release(int) release} multiple
 * permits at a time.  Beware of the increased risk of indefinite
 * postponement when using the multiple acquire.  If a single permit is
 * released to a semaphore that is currently blocking, a thread waiting
 * for one permit will acquire it before a thread waiting for multiple
 * permits regardless of the call order.
 * <p/>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Correct usage of a semaphore is established by programming convention in the application.
 * </ul>
