/**
 * ISemaphore is a fault-tolerant distributed alternative to the
 * {@link Semaphore}. Semaphores are often used to restrict the number of
 * threads than can access some physical or logical resource.
 * <p>
 * ISemaphore is a cluster-wide counting semaphore. Conceptually, it maintains
 * a set of permits. Each {@link #acquire()} blocks if necessary until a permit
 * is available, and then takes it. Dually, each {@link #release()} adds a
 * permit, potentially releasing a blocking acquirer. However, no actual permit
 * objects are used; the semaphore just keeps a count of the number available
 * and acts accordingly.
 * <p>
 * Hazelcast's distributed semaphore implementation guarantees that threads
 * invoking any of the {@link #acquire() acquire} methods are selected to
 * obtain permits in the order of their invocations (first-in-first-out; FIFO).
 * Note that FIFO ordering implies the order which the primary replica of an
 * {@link ISemaphore} receives these acquire requests. Therefore, it is
 * possible for one member to invoke {@code acquire} before another member,
 * but its request hits the primary replica after the other member.
 * <p>
 * This class also provides convenience methods, such as
 * {@link #acquire(int) acquire} and {@link #release(int) release}, to work
 * with multiple permits at once. Beware of the increased risk of
 * indefinite postponement when using the multiple-permit acquire. If permits
 * are released one by one, a thread waiting for one permit will acquire
 * it before a thread waiting for multiple permits regardless of the call order.
 * <p>
 * Correct usage of a semaphore is established by programming convention
 * in the application.
 * <p>
 * As of version 3.12, Hazelcast offers 2 different {@link ISemaphore} impls.
 * Behaviour of {@link ISemaphore} under failure scenarios, including network
 * partitions, depends on the impl. The first impl is the one accessed via
 * {@link HazelcastInstance#getSemaphore(String)}. It works on top of
 * Hazelcast's async replication algorithm and does not guarantee
 * linearizability during failures. During a split-brain scenario, this impl
 * loses its atomicity. It is possible for the same {@link ISemaphore} instance
 * to exist in each side of the network partition and therefore the permit
 * counters can diverge. When the cluster heals, Hazelcast will choose one of
 * the {@link ISemaphore} instances. By default, it is selected from the
 * largest partitioned cluster (by number of members). If the cluster sizes are
 * all equal, then a random {@link ISemaphore} instance will be chosen.
 * <p>
 * This {@link ISemaphore} impl also supports Quorum {@link QuorumConfig}
 * in cluster versions 3.10 and higher. However, Hazelcast quorums do not
 * guarantee strong consistency under failure scenarios.
 * <p>
 * The second impl is a new one introduced with the {@link CPSubsystem} in
 * version 3.12. It is accessed via {@link CPSubsystem#getSemaphore(String)}.
 * It has a major difference to the old implementation, that is, it works on
 * top of the Raft consensus algorithm. It offers linearizability during crash
 * failures and network partitions. It is CP with respect to the CAP principle.
 * If a network partition occurs, it remains available on at most one side of
 * the partition.
 * <p>
 * The new CP impl has 2 variations:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * The default impl accessed via {@link CPSubsystem} is session-aware. In this
 * one, when a caller makes its very first {@link #acquire()} call, it starts
 * a new CP session with the underlying CP group. Then, liveliness of the
 * caller is tracked via this CP session. When the caller fails, permits
 * acquired by this caller are automatically and safely released. However,
 * the session-aware version comes with a limitation, that is,
 * a HazelcastInstance cannot release permits before acquiring them
 * first. In other words, a HazelcastInstance can release only
 * the permits it has acquired earlier. It means, you can acquire a permit
 * from one thread and release it from another thread using the same
 * HazelcastInstance, but not different instances of HazelcastInstance. This
 * behaviour is not compatible with {@link Semaphore#release()}. You can use
 * the session-aware CP {@link ISemaphore} impl by disabling JDK compatibility
 * via {@link CPSemaphoreConfig#setJDKCompatible(boolean)}. Although
 * the session-aware impl has a minor difference to the JDK Semaphore, we think
 * it is a better fit for distributed environments because of its safe
 * auto-cleanup mechanism for acquired permits. Please see
 * {@link CPSession} for the rationale behind the session mechanism.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * The second impl offered by {@link CPSubsystem} is sessionless. This impl
 * does not perform auto-cleanup of acquired permits on failures. Acquired
 * permits are not bound to threads and permits can be released without
 * acquiring first. This one is compatible with {@link Semaphore#release()}.
 * However, you need to handle failed permit owners on your own. If a Hazelcast
 * server or a client fails while holding some permits, they will not be
 * automatically released. You can use the sessionless CP {@link ISemaphore}
 * impl by enabling JDK compatibility via
 * {@link CPSemaphoreConfig#setJDKCompatible(boolean)}.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * There is a subtle difference between the lock and semaphore abstractions.
 * A lock can be assigned to at most one endpoint at a time, so we have a total
 * order among its holders. However, permits of a semaphore can be assigned to
 * multiple endpoints at a time, which implies that we may not have a total
 * order among permit holders. In fact, permit holders are partially ordered.
 * For this reason, the fencing token approach, which is explained in
 * {@link FencedLock}, does not work for the semaphore abstraction. Moreover,
 * each permit is an independent entity. Multiple permit acquires and reentrant
 * lock acquires of a single endpoint are not equivalent. The only case where
 * a semaphore behaves like a lock is the binary case, where the semaphore has
 * only 1 permit. In this case, the semaphore works like a non-reentrant lock.
 * <p>
 * All of the API methods in the new CP {@link ISemaphore} impl offer
 * the exactly-once execution semantics for the session-aware version.
 * For instance, even if a {@link #release()} call is internally retried
 * because of a crashed Hazelcast member, the permit is released only once.
 * However, this guarantee is not given for the sessionless, a.k.a,
 * JDK-compatible CP {@link ISemaphore}. For this version, you can tune
 * execution semantics via
 * {@link CPSubsystemConfig#setFailOnIndeterminateOperationState(boolean)}.
