    /**
     * Returns either a local Hazelcast instance or a "bootstrapped" Hazelcast
     * client for a remote Hazelcast cluster, depending on the context. The main
     * goal of this factory method is to simplify submitting a Jet job to a remote
     * Hazelcast cluster while also making it convenient to test on the local
     * machine.
     * <p>
     * When you submit a job to a Hazelcast instance that runs locally in your
     * JVM, it will have all the dependency classes available. However, when
     * you take the same job to a remote Hazelcast cluster, you'll often find
     * that it fails with a {@code ClassNotFoundException} because the remote
     * cluster doesn't have all the classes you use in the job.
     * <p>
     * Normally you would have to explicitly add all the dependency classes to
     * the {@link JobConfig#addClass(Class[]) JobConfig}, either one by one or
     * packaged into a JAR. If you're submitting a job using the command-line
     * tool {@code hazelcast submit}, the JAR to attach is the same JAR that
     * contains the code that submits the job.
     * <p>
     * This factory takes all of the above into account in order to provide a
     * smoother experience:
     * <ul><li>
     *     When not called from {@code hazelcast submit}, it returns a local {@code
     *     HazelcastInstance}, either by creating a new one or looking up a cached one.
     *     The instance won't join any cluster.
     * <li>
     *     When called from {@code hazelcast submit}, it returns a "bootstrapped"
     *     instance of Hazelcast client that automatically attaches the JAR to all jobs
     *     you submit using it.
     * </ul>
     * With these semantics in place it's simple to write code that works both
     * in your local development/testing environment (using a local Hazelcast
     * instance) and in production (using the remote cluster).
     * <p>
     * To use this feature, follow these steps:
     * <ol><li>
     *     Write your {@code main()} method and your code the usual way, making
     *     sure you use this method (instead of {@link HazelcastClient#newHazelcastClient()})
     *     to acquire a Hazelcast client instance.
     * <li>
     *     Create a runnable JAR (e.g. {@code jet-job.jar}) with your entry point
     *     declared as the {@code Main-Class} in {@code MANIFEST.MF}. The JAR should
     *     include all dependencies required to run it (except the Hazelcast classes
     *     &mdash; these are already available on the cluster classpath).
     * <li>
     *     Submit the job by writing {@code hazelcast submit hz-job.jar} on
     *     the command line. This assumes you have downloaded the Hazelcast
     *     distribution package and its {@code bin} directory is on your system
     *     path. The Hazelcast client will use the configuration file {@code
     *     <distro_root>/config/hazelcast-client.yaml}. Adjust that file as
     *     needed.
     * <li>
     *     The same code will work if you run it directly from your IDE. In this
     *     case it will create a local Hazelcast instance for itself to run on.
     * </ol>
     * For example, you can write a class like this:
     * <pre>
     * public class CustomJetJob {
     *   public static void main(String[] args) {
     *     HazelcastInstance hz = Hazelcast.bootstrappedInstance();
     *     hz.getJet().newJob(buildPipeline()).join();
     *   }
     *
     *   public static Pipeline buildPipeline() {
     *       // ...
     *   }
     * }
     * </pre>
     *
     * @since 5.0
