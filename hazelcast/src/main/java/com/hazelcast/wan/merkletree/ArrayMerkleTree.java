/**
 * A not thread-safe, array based {@link MerkleTree} implementation, which
 * represents each node of the tree as a single {@code int} containing
 * the node's hash.
 * <p>
 * The array representation of the tree comes with optimal memory footprint
 * and memory layout. The memory layout is leveraged by the breadth-first
 * (and breadth-last) traversal of the tree such as recalculating the
 * hash for each non-leaf node. This traversal is optimal, since it is
 * a sequential memory walk coming with low CPU cache miss rates, which
 * in the case of a deep tree enables much better performance compared
 * to the linked representation of the tree.
 * <p>
 * The nodes in this implementation are referenced by their breadth-first
 * order in the tree. Using this order as reference comes with the
 * following properties:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The order of a node is unique for each node and refers to the node
 * on the same level and position in every binary tree. This makes a single
 * node easily referable even between clusters.
 * <li>The order of a node intrinsically encodes the level of the tree on
 * which the given node is. See {@link MerkleTreeUtil#getLevelOfNode(int)}
 * <li>The order of a node also intrinsically encodes the hash range that
 * the node covers since the followings are known based on the order:
 * <ol>
 * <li>the level the node is on
 * <li>the number of the nodes on the same level
 * <li>the node's relative order from the leftmost node on the same
 * level
 * <li>because of the points above and that the codomain of the hash
 * function is known (32 bit ints), the range of the hashes that a single
 * node on the given level covers is known, hence the range covered by a
 * concrete node can be calculated.
 * See {@link MerkleTreeUtil#getNodeHashRangeOnLevel(int)},
 * {@link MerkleTreeUtil#getNodeRangeLow(int)},
 * {@link MerkleTreeUtil#getNodeRangeHigh(int)}
 * </ol>
 * <li>The offset of a node can be calculated easily and cheaply with
 * as {@code offset = order * NODE_SIZE}.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Every leaf of the tree may cover multiple elements in the underlying
 * data structure. These elements are key-value pairs and the keys of the
 * elements are stored in a data structure that are referred to as data
 * blocks. This implementation stores the keys in {@link OAHashSet}s, one
 * set for each leaf. These sets are initialized in tree construction time
 * eagerly with initial capacity one.
 * <p>
 * This implementation updates the tree synchronously. It can do that,
 * since updating a leaf's hash doesn't need to access the values belong
 * to the leaf, thank to the not order-sensitive hash function in use.
 * See {@link MerkleTreeUtil#addHash(int, int)},
 * {@link MerkleTreeUtil#removeHash(int, int)},
 * {@link MerkleTreeUtil#sumHash(int, int)}
