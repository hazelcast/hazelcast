     * Order of search paths is important. If several search paths are defined, then the first path will be searched first, etc.
     * For example if a table with the same name is defined in {@code schema1} and {@code schema2}, and the following search
     * paths are provided {@code {"hazelcast", "schema1"}, {"hazelcast", "schema2"}}, then {@code SELECT * FROM table} will pick
     * the table from the {@code schema1}.
