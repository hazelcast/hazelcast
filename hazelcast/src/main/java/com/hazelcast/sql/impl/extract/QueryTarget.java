/**
 * Target that is used to extract values from map entry's key or value.
 * <p>
 * Extractors are created once per query using the {@link #createExtractor(String, QueryDataType)} method. The target is then
 * updated for every map record using the {@link #setTarget(Object)} method, while extractors remain the same.
 * <p>
 * The motivation for this design is to minimize the overhead on extractors creation and to avoid constant overhead associated
 * with data extraction, by maintaining the state. An example is {@code PortableGetter} that opens a reader on every get
 * operation. Instead, the reader might be opened in {@code setTarget} once and then reused for all fields.
