/**
 * The event journal is a container for events related to a data structure.
 * This interface provides methods for cache event journals. This includes
 * events such as add, update, remove, evict and others. Each cache and
 * partition has it's own event journal.
 * <p>
 * If a cache is destroyed or the migrated, the related event journal will be destroyed or
 * migrated as well. In this sense, the event journal is co-located with the cache partition
 * and it's replicas.
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE :</b>
 * Cache evictions are based on random samples which are then compared according to
 * an eviction policy. This is done separately on the partition owner and the backup replica
 * and can cause different entries to be evicted on the primary and backup replica.
 * Because of this, the record store can contain different entries and the event journal
 * can contain eviction/remove events for different entries on different replicas. This may
 * cause some issues if the partition owner crashes and the backup replica is promoted to
 * the partition owner. Readers of the event journal will then continue reading from the
 * promoted replica and may get update and remove events for entries which have already
 * been removed.
 *
 * @since 3.9
