/**
 * <p>This package contains IExecutorService functionality for Hazelcast.<br/>
 * The IExecutorService extends the {@link java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService} and provides all kinds
 * of additional methods related to distributed systems. You can execute a task on a particular member, all members
 * or a subset of members. You can also execute a task on a member which own a particular partition. This is very
 * useful if you want to reduce the number of remote calls; it is better to send the logic to the data than to
 * pull the data to the logic.
