/**
 * <p>The LifecycleMapper interface is a more sophisticated version of {@link Mapper} normally used for more complex
 * algorithms with a need for initialization and finalization.</p>
 * <p>The behavior is the same as for {@link Mapper}, but {@link #initialize(Context)} is called before calling
 * {@link #map(Object, Object, Context)} for the first time to prepare the mapper instance and maybe already
 * emit some values. After all mapping calls are finished, {@link #finalized(Context)} is called and here is
 * another possibility to emit additional key-value pairs.</p>
 *
 * @param <KeyIn>    type of key used in the {@link KeyValueSource}
 * @param <ValueIn>  type of value used in the {@link KeyValueSource}
 * @param <KeyOut>   key type for mapped results
 * @param <ValueOut> value type for mapped results
 * @since 3.2
 * @deprecated MapReduce is deprecated and will be removed in 4.0.
 * For map aggregations, you can use {@link com.hazelcast.aggregation.Aggregator} on IMap.
 * For general data processing, it is superseded by <a href="http://jet.hazelcast.org">Hazelcast Jet</a>.
