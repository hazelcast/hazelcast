/**
 * <p>
 * This interface describes a mapreduce Job that is build by {@link JobTracker#newJob(KeyValueSource)}.<br>
 * It is used to execute mappings and calculations on the different cluster nodes and reduce or collate these mapped
 * values to results.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Implementations returned by the JobTracker are fully threadsafe and can be used concurrently and multiple
 * times <b>once the configuration is finished</b>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Caution: The generic types of Jobs change depending on the used methods, which can make it necessary to use
 * different assignment variables when used over multiple source lines.</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An example on how to use it:
 * <pre>
 * HazelcastInstance hz = getHazelcastInstance();
 * IMap&lt;Integer, Integer> map = (...) hz.getMap( "default" );
 * JobTracker tracker = hz.getJobTracker( "default" );
 * Job&lt;Integer, Integer> job = tracker.newJob( KeyValueSource.fromMap( map ) );
 * ICompletableFuture&lt;Map&lt;String, Integer>> future = job
 *      .mapper( buildMapper() ).reducer( buildReducer() ).submit();
 * Map&lt;String, Integer> results = future.get();
 * </pre>
 * </p>
 *
 * @param <KeyIn>   type of key used as input key type
 * @param <ValueIn> type of value used as input value type
 * @since 3.2
 * @deprecated MapReduce is deprecated and will be removed in 4.0.
 * For map aggregations, you can use {@link com.hazelcast.aggregation.Aggregator} on IMap.
 * For general data processing, it is superseded by <a href="http://jet.hazelcast.org">Hazelcast Jet</a>.
