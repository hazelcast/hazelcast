/**
 * The Aggregation interface combines multiple map-reduce operations steps to a
 * single operation definition. It is a predefined set of {@link com.hazelcast.mapreduce.Mapper},
 * {@link com.hazelcast.mapreduce.Combiner}, {@link com.hazelcast.mapreduce.Reducer} and
 * probably a {@link com.hazelcast.mapreduce.Collator} to execute an aggregation over a
 * supplied set of data.
 * <p/>
 * As you'll see in the following example, the Aggregations API is fully type-safe. Due to the lack of
 * full type inference support on Java 6 and Java 7, it seems more verbose than it actually is.
 * <pre>
 * IMap&lt;String, Employee> map = hazelcastInstance.getMap("employees");
 * Supplier&lt;String, Employee, Integer> supplier = Supplier.all((employee) -> employee.getSalaryPerMonth());
 * Aggregation&lt;String, Integer, Integer> aggregation = Aggregations.integerAvg();
 * int avgSalary = map.aggregate(supplier, aggregation);
 * </pre>
 * With Java 8 it is possible to write that all in just one line so that the API becomes very straight forward.
 * <pre>
 * IMap&lt;String, Employee> map = hazelcastInstance.getMap("employees");
 * int avgSalary = map.aggregate(Supplier.all((employee) -> employee.getSalaryPerMonth(), Aggregations.integerAvg());
 * </pre>
 *
 * @param <Key>      the input key type
 * @param <Supplied> the value type returned from the {@link com.hazelcast.mapreduce.aggregation.Supplier}
 * @param <Result>   the value type returned from the aggregation
 * @since 3.3
 * @deprecated Use new fast-aggregations {@link IMap#aggregate(Aggregator)} or {@link IMap#aggregate(Aggregator, Predicate)}.
