/**
 * <p>
 * The interface Mapper is used to build mappers for the {@link Job}. Most mappers will only need to
 * implement this interface and the {@link #map(Object, Object, Context)} method to collect and emit needed
 * key-value pairs.<br>
 * For more complex algorithms there is the possibility to implement the {@link LifecycleMapper} interface and
 * override the {@link LifecycleMapper#initialize(Context)} and {@link LifecycleMapper#finalized(Context)}
 * methods as well.</p>
 * <p>
 * A simple mapper could look like the following example:
 * <pre>
 * public class MyMapper extends Mapper&lt;Integer, Integer, String, Integer>
 * {
 *   public void map( Integer key, Integer value, Context&lt;String, Integer> context )
 *   {
 *     context.emit( String.valueOf( key ), value );
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * </p>

 * href="http://research.google.com/archive/mapreduce-osdi04.pdf">Google Whitepaper on MapReduce</a>}.
 * </p>
 *
 * @param <KeyIn>    The type of key used in the {@link KeyValueSource}
 * @param <ValueIn>  The type of value used in the {@link KeyValueSource}
 * @param <KeyOut>   The key type for mapped results
 * @param <ValueOut> The value type for mapped results
 * @since 3.2
 * @deprecated MapReduce is deprecated and will be removed in 4.0.
 * For map aggregations, you can use {@link com.hazelcast.aggregation.Aggregator} on IMap.
 * For general data processing, it is superseded by <a href="http://jet.hazelcast.org">Hazelcast Jet</a>.
