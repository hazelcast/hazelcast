/**
 * <p>This package contains the MapReduce API definition for Hazelcast.<br/>
 * All map reduce operations running in a distributed manner inside the
 * active Hazelcast cluster. Therefor {@link com.hazelcast.mapreduce.Mapper},
 * {@link com.hazelcast.mapreduce.Combiner} and {@link com.hazelcast.mapreduce.Reducer}
 * implementations need to be fully serializable by Hazelcast. Any of the
 * existing serialization patterns are available for those classes, too.<br/>
 * If custom {@link com.hazelcast.mapreduce.KeyValueSource} is provided above
 * statement also applies to this implementation.</p>
 * <p>For a basic idea how to use this framework see {@link com.hazelcast.mapreduce.Job}
 * or {@link com.hazelcast.mapreduce.Mapper}, {@link com.hazelcast.mapreduce.Combiner} or
 * {@link com.hazelcast.mapreduce.Reducer}.</p>
 *
 * @since 3.2
 * @deprecated MapReduce is deprecated and will be removed in 4.0.
 * For map aggregations, you can use {@link com.hazelcast.aggregation.Aggregator} on IMap.
 * For general data processing, it is superseded by <a href="http://jet.hazelcast.org">Hazelcast Jet</a>.
