/**
 * Represents a CP session.
 * <p>
 * For CP data structures that involve resource ownership management, such as
 * locks or semaphores, sessions are required to keep track of liveliness of
 * callers. In this context, "caller" means an entity that uses CP Subsystem
 * APIs. It can be either a Hazelcast server or client. A caller initially
 * creates a session before sending its very first session-based request to a
 * CP group, such as a lock / semaphore acquire. After creating a session on
 * the CP group, the caller stores its session id locally and sends it
 * alongside its session-based operations. A single session is used for all
 * lock and semaphore proxies of the caller. When a CP group receives
 * a session-based operation, it checks the validity of the session using
 * the session id information available in the operation. A session is valid if
 * it is still open in the CP group. An operation with a valid session id is
 * accepted as a new session heartbeat. While a caller is idle, in other words,
 * it does not send any session-based operation to the CP group for a while, it
 * commits periodic heartbeats to the CP group in the background in order to
 * keep its session alive. This interval is specified in
 * {@link CPSubsystemConfig#getSessionHeartbeatIntervalSeconds()}.
 * <p>
 * A session is closed when the caller does not touch the session during
 * a predefined duration. In this case, the caller is assumed to be crashed and
 * all its resources are released automatically. This duration is specified in
 * {@link CPSubsystemConfig#getSessionTimeToLiveSeconds()}. Please check
 * {@link CPSubsystemConfig} for recommendations to choose a reasonable session
 * time-to-live duration.
 * <p>
 * Sessions offer a trade-off between liveliness and safety. If a very small
 * value is set to {@link CPSubsystemConfig#setSessionTimeToLiveSeconds(int)},
 * then a session owner could be considered crashed very quickly and its
 * resources can be released prematurely. On the other hand, if a large value
 * is set, a session could be kept alive for an unnecessarily long duration
 * even if its owner actually crashes. However, it is a safer approach to
 * not to use a small session time to live duration. If a session owner is
 * known to be crashed, its session could be closed manually via
 * {@link CPSessionManagementService#forceCloseSession(String, long)}.
