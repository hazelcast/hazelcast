/**
 * When a CP member is added to a Raft group, a new member list is committed to

 * committed to the Raft group. After the new member list is committed to
 * the Raft group itself, the new member can receive append requests and it can
 * try to initialize its local {@link RaftNode} instance. In order to the
 * initialize itself, it can directly ask to the Raft group to verify if it is
 * a current member of the Raft group.
 * <p>
 * This operation is NOT committed to the Metadata group.
