 * Marker interface for all operations used in Raft system.

 * features:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code AllowedDuringPassiveState}: Raft operations are submitted while
 * a node is shutting down to replace shutting down member with a new one.
 * </li>
 * <li>{@code ReadonlyOperation}: Raft operations are executed on partition
 * threads but not sent to partition owners. To avoid invocations fail with
 * {@code PartitionMigratingException}, we mark them as read-only from
 * Hazelcast partitioning system perspective.
 * </li>
