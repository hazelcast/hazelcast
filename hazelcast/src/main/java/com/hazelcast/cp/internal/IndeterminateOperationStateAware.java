/**
 * When a {@link RaftOp} is replicated to the leader of a Raft group,
 * but the leader fails before it sends any response, the caller has no idea
 * about the status of its operation. The possible cases are:
 * - the failed leader did not append the operation,
 * - the failed leader appended the operation but not committed yet,
 * - the failed leader committed the operation.
 * <p>
 * In this case, we check if the operation is safe to retry. The operation is
 * considered to be safe to retry only if it implements this interface and
 * {@link #isRetryableOnIndeterminateOperationState()} method returns
 * {@code true}. If this is the case, the operation will be retried. Otherwise,
 * we do not know if the operation is safe or not. In this case, we make a
 * decision between offering at-most-once and at-least-once execution
 * semantics via the
 * {@link CPSubsystemConfig#failOnIndeterminateOperationState} configuration.
 * If this configuration is enabled, we do not retry the operation and fail
 * with {@link IndeterminateOperationStateException}, hence offer at-most-once
 * semantics. Otherwise, we retry the operation and we are fine with a possible
 * duplicate commit of the operation.
