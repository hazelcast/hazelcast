 * An abstraction to implement blocking Raft ops. A blocking Raft op requires
 * caller information to be provided before the Raft op is being replicated
 * and committed by the Raft consensus algorithm. The Raft invocation mechanism
 * provides this functionality. Once the Raft op is committed, it is reported
 * as a live operation to the Hazelcast's invocation system, even if the total
 * wait duration is longer then the configured operation timeout duration.
 * A blocking Raft op can fail with operation timeout if it is not committed
 * before the configured operation timeout duration passes.
