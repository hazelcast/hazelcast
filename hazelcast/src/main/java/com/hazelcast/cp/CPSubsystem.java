/**
 * CP Subsystem is a component of Hazelcast that builds a strongly consistent
 * layer for a set of distributed data structures. Its APIs can be used for
 * implementing distributed coordination use cases, such as leader election,
 * distributed locking, synchronization, and metadata management.
 * It is accessed via {@link HazelcastInstance#getCPSubsystem()}. Its data
 * structures are CP with respect to the CAP principle, i.e., they always
 * maintain linearizability and prefer consistency over availability during
 * network partitions. Besides network partitions, CP Subsystem withstands
 * server and client failures.
 * <p>
 * Currently, CP Subsystem contains only the implementations of Hazelcast's
 * concurrency APIs. Since these APIs do not maintain large states, all members
 * of a Hazelcast cluster do not necessarily take part in CP Subsystem.
 * The number of Hazelcast members that takes part in CP Subsystem is specified
 * with {@link CPSubsystemConfig#setCPMemberCount(int)}. Say that it is
 * configured as N. Then, when a Hazelcast cluster starts, the first N members
 * form CP Subsystem. These members are called {@link CPMember}s, and they can
 * also contain data for other regular -AP- Hazelcast data structures, such as
 * {@link IMap}, {@link ISet}.
 * <p>
 * Data structures in CP Subsystem run in {@link CPGroup}s. Each CP group
 * elects its own Raft leader and runs the Raft consensus algorithm
 * independently. CP Subsystem runs 2 CP groups by default. The first one is
 * the METADATA CP group which is an internal CP group responsible for managing
 * CP members and CP groups. It is initialized during cluster startup if CP
 * Subsystem is enabled via {@link CPSubsystemConfig#setCPMemberCount(int)}.
 * The second CP group is the DEFAULT CP group, whose name is given in
 * {@link CPGroup#DEFAULT_GROUP_NAME}. If a group name is not specified while
 * creating a CP data structure proxy, that data structure is mapped to
 * the DEFAULT CP group. For instance, when a CP {@link IAtomicLong} instance
 * is created via {@code .getAtomicLong("myAtomicLong")}, it is initialized on
 * the DEFAULT CP group. Besides these 2 pre-defined CP groups, custom CP
 * groups can be created at run-time while fetching CP data structure proxies.
 * For instance, if a CP {@link IAtomicLong} is created by calling
 * {@code .getAtomicLong("myAtomicLong@myGroup")}, first a new CP group is
 * created with the name "myGroup" and then "myAtomicLong" is initialized on
 * this custom CP group.
 * <p>
 * This design implies that each CP member can participate to more than one CP
 * group. CP Subsystem runs a periodic background task to ensure that each CP
 * member performs the Raft leadership role for roughly equal number of CP
 * groups. For instance, if there are 3 CP members and 3 CP groups, each CP
 * member becomes Raft leader for only 1 CP group. If one more CP group is
 * created, then one of the CP members gets the Raft leader role for 2 CP
 * groups. This is done because Raft is a leader-based consensus algorithm.
 * A Raft leader node becomes responsible for handling incoming requests from
 * callers and replicating them to follower nodes. If a CP member gets the Raft
 * leadership role for too many CP groups compared to other CP members, it can
 * turn into a bottleneck.
 * <p>
 * CP member count of CP groups are specified via
 * {@link CPSubsystemConfig#setGroupSize(int)}. Please note that this
 * configuration does not have to be same with the CP member count. Namely,
 * number of CP members in CP Subsystem can be larger than the configured
 * CP group size. CP groups usually consist of an odd number of CP members
 * between 3 and 7. Operations are committed &amp; executed only after they are
 * successfully replicated to the majority of CP members in a CP group.
 * An odd number of CP members is more advantageous to an even number because
 * of the quorum or majority calculations. For a CP group of N members,
 * majority is calculated as N / 2 + 1. For instance, in a CP group of 5 CP
 * members, operations are committed when they are replicated to at least 3 CP
 * members. This CP group can tolerate failure of 2 CP members and remain
 * available. However, if we run a CP group with 6 CP members, it can still
 * tolerate failure of 2 CP members because majority of 6 is 4. Therefore,
 * it does not improve the degree of fault tolerance compared to 5 CP members.
 * <p>
 * CP Subsystem achieves horizontal scalability thanks to all of
 * the aforementioned CP group management capabilities. You can scale out
 * the throughput and memory capacity by distributing your CP data structures
 * to multiple CP groups (i.e., manual partitioning / sharding) and
 * distributing those CP groups over CP members (i.e., choosing a CP group size
 * that is smaller than the CP member count configuration). Nevertheless,
 * the current set of CP data structures have quite low memory overheads.
 * Moreover, related to the Raft consensus algorithm, each CP group makes use
 * of internal heartbeat RPCs to maintain authority of the Raft leader and help
 * lagging CP group members to make progress. Last, the new CP lock and
 * semaphore implementations rely on a brand new session mechanism. In a
 * nutshell, a Hazelcast server or a client starts a new session on the
 * corresponding CP group when it makes its very first lock or semaphore
 * acquire request, and then periodically commits session heartbeats to this CP
 * group in order to indicate its liveliness. It means that if CP locks and
 * semaphores are distributed to multiple CP groups, there will be a session
 * management overhead on each CP group. Please see {@link CPSession} for more
 * details. For these reasons, we recommend developers to use a minimal number
 * of CP groups. For most use cases, the DEFAULT CP group should be sufficient
 * to maintain all CP data structure instances. Custom CP groups is recommended
 * only when you benchmark your deployment and decide that performance of
 * the DEFAULT CP group is not sufficient for your workload.
 * <p>
 * CP Subsystem runs a discovery process on cluster startup. When CP Subsystem
 * is enabled by setting a positive value to
 * {@link CPSubsystemConfig#setCPMemberCount(int)}, say N, the first N members
 * in the Hazelcast cluster member list initiate this discovery process. Other
 * Hazelcast members skip this step. The CP discovery process runs out of
 * the box on top of Hazelcast's cluster member list without requiring any
 * custom configuration for different environments. It is completed when each
 * one of the first N Hazelcast members initializes its local CP member list
 * and commits it to the METADATA CP group. <strong>A soon-to-be CP member
 * terminates itself if any of the following conditions occur before the CP
 * discovery process is completed:</strong>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Any Hazelcast member leaves the cluster,</li>
 * <li>The local Hazelcast member commits a CP member list which is different
 * from other members' committed CP member lists,</li>
 * <li>The local Hazelcast member fails to commit its discovered CP member list
 * for any reason.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <strong>The CP data structure proxies differ from the other Hazelcast data
 * structure proxies in two aspects. First, an internal commit is performed on
 * the METADATA CP group every time you fetch a proxy from this interface.
 * Hence, callers should cache returned proxy objects. Second, if you call
 * {@link DistributedObject#destroy()} on a CP data structure proxy, that data
 * structure is terminated on the underlying CP group and cannot be
 * reinitialized until the CP group is force-destroyed via
 * {@link CPSubsystemManagementService#forceDestroyCPGroup(String)}. For this
 * reason, please make sure that you are completely done with a CP data
 * structure before destroying its proxy.</strong>
 * <p>
 * By default, CP Subsystem works only in memory without persisting any state
 * to disk. It means that a crashed CP member is not able to join to
 * the cluster back by restoring its previous state. Therefore, crashed CP
 * members create a danger for gradually losing majority of CP groups and
 * eventually cause the total loss of availability of CP Subsystem. To prevent
 * such situations, crashed CP members can be removed from CP Subsystem and
 * replaced in CP groups with other available CP members. This flexibility
 * provides a good degree of fault-tolerance at run-time. Please see
 * {@link CPSubsystemConfig} and {@link CPSubsystemManagementService} for more
 * details.
 * <p>
 * CP Subsystem offers disk persistence as well. When it is enabled via
 * {@link CPSubsystemConfig#setPersistenceEnabled(boolean)}, CP members persist
 * their local state to stable storage and can restore their state after
 * crashes. This capability significantly improves the overall reliability of
 * CP Subsystem by enabling recovery of crashed CP members. When you restart
 * crashed CP members, they restore their local state and resume working as if
 * they have never crashed. If you cannot restart a CP member on the same
 * machine, you can move its data to another machine and restart it with a new
 * address. CP Subsystem Persistence enables you to handle single or multiple CP
 * member crashes, or even whole cluster crashes and guarantee that committed
 * operations are not lost after recovery. In other words, CP member crashes
 * and restarts do not create any consistency problem. As long as majority of
 * CP members are available after recovery, CP Subsystem remains operational.
 * <p>
 * When CP Subsystem Persistence is enabled, all Hazelcast cluster members
 * create a sub-directory under the base persistence directory which is
 * specified via {@link CPSubsystemConfig#getBaseDir()}. This means that AP
 * Hazelcast members, which are the ones not marked as CP members during
 * the CP discovery process, create their persistence directories as well.
 * Those members persist only the information that they are not CP members.
 * This is done because when a Hazelcast member starts with CP Subsystem
 * Persistence enabled, it checks if there is a CP persistence directory
 * belonging to itself. If it founds one, it skips the CP discovery process and
 * initializes its CP member identity from the persisted data. If it was an AP
 * member before shutdown or crash, it restores this information and starts as
 * an AP member. Otherwise, it could think that the CP discovery process has
 * not been executed and trigger it, which would break CP Subsystem.
 * <p>
 * <strong>In light of this information, If you have both CP and AP members
 * in your cluster when CP Subsystem Persistence is enabled, and if you want to
 * perform a cluster-wide restart, you need to ensure that AP members are also
 * restarted with their CP persistence directories.</strong>
 * <p>
 * There is a significant behavioral difference during CP member shutdown when
 * CP Subsystem Persistence is enabled and disabled. When disabled (the default
 * mode in which CP Subsystem works only in memory), a shutting down CP member
 * is replaced with other available CP members in all of its CP groups in order
 * not to decrease or more importantly not to lose majorities of CP groups.
 * It is because CP members keep their local state only in memory when CP
 * Subsystem Persistence is disabled, hence a shut-down CP member cannot join
 * back with its CP identity and state, hence it is better to remove it from CP
 * Subsystem to not to harm availability of CP groups. If there is no other
 * available CP member to replace a shutting down CP member in a CP group, that
 * CP group's size is reduced by 1 and its majority value is recalculated.
 * On the other hand, when CP Subsystem Persistence is enabled, a shut-down CP
 * member can come back by restoring its CP state. Therefore, it is not
 * automatically removed from CP Subsystem when CP Subsystem Persistence is
 * enabled. It is up to the user to remove shut-down CP members
 * via {@link CPSubsystemManagementService#removeCPMember(UUID)} )} if they will
 * not come back.
 * <p>
 * In summary, CP member shutdown behaviour is as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>When CP Subsystem Persistence is disabled (the default mode),
 * shut-down CP members are removed from CP Subsystem and CP group majority
 * values are recalculated.</li>
 * <li>When CP Subsystem Persistence is enabled, shut-down CP members are
 * still kept as part of CP Subsystem so they will be part of CP group majority
 * calculations.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <strong>Moreover, there is a subtle point about concurrent shutdown of CP
 * members when CP Subsystem Persistence is disabled. If there are N CP members
 * in CP Subsystem, {@link HazelcastInstance#shutdown()} can be called on N-2
 * CP members concurrently. Once these N-2 CP members complete their shutdown,
 * the remaining 2 CP members must be shut down serially. Even though
 * the shutdown API can be called concurrently on multiple CP members, since
 * the METADATA CP group handles shutdown requests serially, it would be simpler
 * to shut down CP members one by one, by calling
 * {@link HazelcastInstance#shutdown()} on the next CP member once the current
 * CP member completes its shutdown. This rule does not apply when CP Subsystem
 * Persistence is enabled so you can shut down your CP members concurrently
 * if you enabled CP Subsystem Persistence. Please see {@link CPSubsystem}
 * to learn more about the shut-down behaviour of CP members.</strong> It is
 * enough for users to recall this rule while shutting down CP members when
 * CP Subsystem Persistence is disabled. Interested users can read the rest of
 * this paragraph to learn the reasoning behind this rule. Each shutdown
 * request internally requires a Raft commit to the METADATA CP group when CP
 * Subsystem Persistence is disabled. A CP member proceeds to shutdown after it
 * receives a response of this commit. To be able to perform a Raft commit,
 * the METADATA CP group must have its majority up and running. When only 2 CP
 * members are left after graceful shutdowns, the majority of the METADATA CP
 * group becomes 2. If the last 2 CP members shut down concurrently, one of
 * them is likely to perform its Raft commit faster than the other one and
 * leave the cluster before the other CP member completes its Raft commit.
 * In this case, the last CP member waits for a response of its commit attempt
 * on the METADATA CP group, and times out eventually. This situation causes
 * an unnecessary delay on shutdown process of the last CP member. On the other
 * hand, when the last 2 CP members shut down serially, the N-1th member
 * receives the response of its commit after its shutdown request is committed
 * also on the last CP member. Then, the last CP member checks its local data
 * to notice that it is the last CP member alive, and proceeds its shutdown
 * without attempting a Raft commit on the METADATA CP group.
 * <p>
 * CP Subsystem's fault tolerance capabilities are summarized below.
 * For the sake of simplicity, let's assume that both the CP member count and
 * CP group size configurations are configured as the same and we use only
 * the DEFAULT CP group. <strong>In the list below, "a permanent crash"
 * means that a CP member either crashes while CP Subsystem Persistence is
 * disabled, hence it cannot be recovered with its CP identity and data, or
 * it crashes while CP Subsystem Persistence is enabled but its CP data cannot
 * be recovered, for instance, due to a total server crash or a disk failure.
 * </strong>
 * <ul>
 * <li>If a CP member leaves the Hazelcast cluster, it is not automatically
 * removed from CP Subsystem because CP Subsystem cannot certainly determine
 * if that member has actually crashed or just disconnected from the cluster.
 * Therefore, absent CP members are still considered in majority calculations
 * and cause a danger for the availability of CP Subsystem. If the user knows
 * for sure that an absent CP member is crashed, she can remove that CP member
 * from CP Subsystem via
 * {@link CPSubsystemManagementService#removeCPMember(UUID)}. This API call
 * removes the given CP member from all CP groups and recalculates their
 * majority values. If there is another available CP member in CP Subsystem,
 * the removed CP member is replaced with that one, or the user can promote
 * an AP member of the Hazelcast cluster to the CP role via
 * {@link CPSubsystemManagementService#promoteToCPMember()}.</li>
 * <li>There might be a small window of unavailability after a CP member crash
 * even if the majority of CP members are still online. For instance, if
 * a crashed CP member is the Raft leader for some CP groups, those CP groups
 * run a new leader election round to elect a new leader among remaining CP
 * group members. CP Subsystem API calls that internally hit those CP groups
 * are retried until they have new Raft leaders. If a failed CP member has
 * the Raft follower role, it causes a very minimal disruption since Raft
 * leaders are still able to replicate and commit operations with the majority
 * of their CP group members.</li>
 * <li>If a crashed CP member is restarted after it is removed from CP
 * Subsystem, its behaviour depends on if CP Subsystem Persistence is enabled
 * or disabled. If CP Subsystem Persistence is enabled, a restarted CP member
 * is not able to restore its CP data from disk because after it joins back to
 * the cluster it notices that it is no longer a CP member. Because of that, it
 * fails its startup process and prints an error message. The only thing to do
 * in this case is manually delete its CP persistence directory since its data
 * is no longer useful. On the other hand, if CP Subsystem Persistence is
 * disabled, a failed CP member cannot remember anything related to its
 * previous CP identity, hence it restarts as a new AP member.</li>
 * <li>A CP member can be encounter a network issue and disconnect from
 * the cluster. If it is removed from CP Subsystem by the user even though this
 * CP member is actually alive but only disconnected, this CP member should be
 * terminated to prevent any accidental communication with the other CP members
 * in CP Subsystem.</li>
 * <li>If a network partition occurs, behaviour of CP Subsystem depends on how
 * CP members are divided in different sides of the network partition and
 * to which sides Hazelcast clients are connected. Each CP group remains
 * available on the side that contains the majority of its CP members. If
 * a Raft leader falls into the minority side, its CP group elects a new Raft
 * leader on the other side and callers that are talking to the majority side
 * continue to make successful API calls on CP Subsystem. However, callers that
 * are talking to the minority side fail with operation timeouts. When
 * the network problem is resolved, CP members reconnect to each other and CP
 * groups continue their operation normally.</li>
 * <li>CP Subsystem can tolerate failure of the minority of CP members (less
 * than N / 2 + 1) for availability. If N / 2 + 1 or more CP members crash, CP
 * Subsystem loses its availability. If CP Subsystem Persistence is enabled and
 * the majority of CP members become online by successfully restarting some of
 * failed CP members, CP Subsystem regains its availability back. <strong>
 * Otherwise, it means that CP Subsystem has lost its majority irrevocably.
 * </strong> In this case, the only solution is to wipe-out the whole CP
 * Subsystem state by performing a force-reset via
 * {@link CPSubsystemManagementService#reset()}.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <strong>When {@link CPSubsystemConfig#getCPMemberCount()} is greater than
 * {@link CPSubsystemConfig#getGroupSize()}, CP groups are formed by selecting
 * a subset of CP members. In this case, each CP group can have a different set
 * of CP members, therefore different fault-tolerance and availability
 * conditions.</strong> In the following list, CP Subsystem's additional fault
 * tolerance capabilities are discussed for this configuration case.
 * <ul>
 * <li>When the majority of a non-METADATA CP group permanently crash, that CP
 * group cannot make progress anymore, even though other CP groups in CP
 * Subsystem are running fine. Even a new CP member cannot join to this CP
 * group, because membership changes also go through the Raft consensus
 * algorithm. For this reason, the only option is to force-destroy this CP
 * group via
 * {@link CPSubsystemManagementService#forceDestroyCPGroup(String)}. When this
 * API is called, the CP group is terminated non-gracefully without the Raft
 * mechanics. After this API call, all existing CP data structure proxies that
 * talk to this CP group fail with {@link CPGroupDestroyedException}. However,
 * if a new proxy is created afterwards, then this CP group is re-created from
 * scratch with a new set of CP members. Losing majority of a non-METADATA CP
 * group can be likened to partition-loss scenario of AP Hazelcast. Please note
 * that non-METADATA CP groups that have lost their majority must be
 * force-destroyed immediately, because they can block the METADATA CP group
 * to perform membership changes on CP Subsystem.</li>
 * <li>If the majority of the METADATA CP group permanently crash,
 * unfortunately it is equivalent to the permanent crash of the majority
 * CP members of the whole CP Subsystem, even though other CP groups are
 * running fine. In fact, existing CP groups continue serving to incoming
 * requests, but since the METADATA CP group is not available anymore, no
 * management tasks can be performed on CP Subsystem. For instance, a new CP
 * group cannot be created. The only solution is to perform a force-reset
 * which wipes-out the whole CP Subsystem state via
 * {@link CPSubsystemManagementService#reset()}.</li>
