/**
 * An eviction policy takes its role after the decision that a map needs to free some memory
 * according to one of {@link com.hazelcast.config.MaxSizeConfig.MaxSizePolicy MaxSizePolicies}
 * and it helps to find most appropriate entries to remove.
 *
 * {@link com.hazelcast.core.IMap IMap} has out-of-the-box eviction policies like {@link LRUEvictionPolicy},
 * {@link LFUEvictionPolicy} and {@link RandomEvictionPolicy} but if there is a need to define another eviction policy,
 * users can introduce a custom one by extending {@link MapEvictionPolicy} class.
 *
 * <p>Implementation:</p>
 * {@link MapEvictionPolicy#compare(EntryView, EntryView)} method must be implemented to provide an ascending order
 * of entries. Because internal eviction algorithm will evict the smallest entry from {@link com.hazelcast.core.IMap IMap}
 *
 * @param <K> the type of keys maintained by IMap
 * @param <V> the type of mapped values
 *
 * @see LRUEvictionPolicy
 * @see LFUEvictionPolicy
 * @see RandomEvictionPolicy
 *
 * @since 3.7
