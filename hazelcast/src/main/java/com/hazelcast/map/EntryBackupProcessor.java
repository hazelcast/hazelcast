 * Processes an entry on a backup partition.

 * Note that there is a possibility which an {@link com.hazelcast.map.EntryProcessor} can see
 * that a key exists but its backup processor {@link com.hazelcast.map.EntryBackupProcessor} may not find it
 * at run time due to an unsent backup of a previous operation (e.g. a previous put). In those situations,
 * Hazelcast internally/eventually will sync those owner and backup partitions so you will not lose any data.
 * When coding an {@link com.hazelcast.map.EntryBackupProcessor}, you should take that case into account, otherwise
 * {@link java.lang.NullPointerException}s can be seen since {@link java.util.Map.Entry#getValue()} may return null.
