 * Note that there is a possibility which an {@link com.hazelcast.map.AbstractEntryProcessor} can see that a key exists
 * but its backup processor may not find it due to an unsent backup of a previous operation (e.g. a previous put).
 * In those situations, Hazelcast internally/eventually will sync those owner and backup partitions so you will not lose any data.
 * Because AbstractEntryProcessor uses the same processor in both owner and backup,
