 * MapInterceptor is used to intercept changes to the map, allowing access to the values before and

 *
 * MapInterceptors are chained when added to the map, which means that when an interceptor is added
 * on node initialization, it could be added twice. To prevent this, make sure to implement the
 * hashCode method to return the same value for every instance of the class.
 *
 * Serialized instances of this interface are used in client-member communication, so changing an implementation's binary format
 * will render it incompatible with its previous versions.
