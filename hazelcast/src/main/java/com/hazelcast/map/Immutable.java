/**
 * Allows notifying Hazelcast code that the object implementing this interface
 * is effectively immutable.
 * This may mean that it either does not have any state (e.g. pure function)
 * or the state is not mutated at any point.
 * This interface allows for performance optimisations where applicable such
 * as avoiding cloning user supplied objects or cloning hazelcast internal
 * objects supplied to the user.
 * It is important that the user follows the rules:
 * <ul>
 * <li>the object must not have any state which is changed by cloning the object</li>
 * <li>the existing state must not be changed</li>
 * </ul>
 * If an object implements this interface but does not follow these rules,
 * the results of the execution are undefined.
