/**
 * A {@link MessageListener} to better integrate with the reliable topic.
 *
 * If a regular MessageListener is registered on a reliable topic, the message listener works fine, but it can't do much
 * more than listen to messages.
 *
 * If a ReliableMessageListener is registered on a normal topic, only the {@link MessageListener} methods will be called.
 *
 * <h1>Durable Subscription</h1>
 * The ReliableMessageListener allows you to control where you want to start processing a message when the listener is
 * registered. This makes it possible to create a durable subscription by storing the sequence of the last message and
 * using this sequenceId as the sequenceId to start from.
 *
 * <h1>Exception handling</h1>
 * The ReliableMessageListener also gives the ability to deal with exceptions using the {@link #isTerminal(Throwable)}
 * method. If a plain MessageListener is used, then it won't terminate on exceptions and it will keep on running. But in some
 * cases it is better to stop running.
 *
 * <h1>Global order</h1>
 * The ReliableMessageListener will always get all events in order (global order). It will not get duplicates and
 * there will only be gaps if it is too slow. For more information see {@link #isLossTolerant()}.
 *
 * <h1>Delivery guarantees</h1>
 * Because the ReliableMessageListener controls which item it wants to continue from upon restart, it is very easy to provide
 * an at-least-once or at-most-once delivery guarantee. The storeSequence is always called before a message is processed;
 * so it can be persisted on some non-volatile storage. When the {@link #retrieveInitialSequence()} returns the stored
 * sequence, then an at-least-once delivery is implemented since the same item is now being processed twice. To implement
 * an at-most-once delivery guarantee, add 1 to the stored sequence when the {@link #retrieveInitialSequence()} is called.
 *
 * @param <E>
