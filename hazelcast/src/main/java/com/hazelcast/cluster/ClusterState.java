 * {@code ClusterState} are several possible states of the cluster

 * There are 5 states:
 * <ol>
 * <li>
 * {@link #ACTIVE}:
 * Cluster will continue to operate without any restriction.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * {@link #NO_MIGRATION}:
 * Migrations (partition rebalancing) and backup replications
 * are not allowed. Cluster will continue to operate without any restriction.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * {@link #FROZEN}:
 * New members are not allowed to join, partition table/assignments will be frozen.
 * All other operations are allowed and will operate without any restriction.
 * If some members leave the cluster while it is in {@code FROZEN} state, they can join back.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * {@link #PASSIVE}:
 * New members are not allowed to join.
 * All operations, except the ones marked with {@link AllowedDuringPassiveState},
 * will be rejected immediately.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * {@link #IN_TRANSITION}:
 * Shows that {@code ClusterState} is in transition.
 * This is a temporary &amp; intermediate state, not allowed to be set explicitly.
 * </li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * By default, cluster will be in {@code ACTIVE} state. During split-brain merge process,
 * state of the cluster, that is going to join to the major side,
 * will be changed to {@code FROZEN} automatically before merge
 * and will be set to the state of the new cluster after merge.
