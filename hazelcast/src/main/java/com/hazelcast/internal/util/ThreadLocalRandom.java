/**
 * A random number generator isolated to the current thread. Like the
 * global {@link java.util.Random} generator used by the {@link
 * java.lang.Math} class, a {@code ThreadLocalRandom} is initialized
 * with an internally generated seed that may not otherwise be
 * modified. When applicable, use of {@code ThreadLocalRandom} rather
 * than shared {@code Random} objects in concurrent programs will
 * typically encounter much less overhead and contention. Use of
 * {@code ThreadLocalRandom} is particularly appropriate when multiple
 * tasks (for example, each a {@code java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinTask})
 * use random numbers in parallel in thread pools.
 *
 * <p>Usages of this class should typically be of the form:
 * {@code ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextX(...)} (where
 * {@code X} is {@code Int}, {@code Long}, etc).
 * When all usages are of this form, it is never possible to
 * accidently share a {@code ThreadLocalRandom} across multiple threads.
 *
 * <p>This class also provides additional commonly used bounded random
 * generation methods.
