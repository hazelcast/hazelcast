 * Responsible for writing {@link OutboundFrame} to a {@link ByteBuffer}. For example a Packet needs to be written to a socket,

 * written to the socket.
 *
 * {@link ChannelOutboundHandler} are not expected to be thread-safe; each channel will gets its own instance(s).
 *
 * A {@link ChannelOutboundHandler} is constructed through a {@link ChannelInitializer}.
 *
 * For more information about the ChannelOutboundHandler (and handlers in generally), have a look at the
 * {@link ChannelInboundHandler}.
 *
 * If the main task of a ChannelOutboundHandler is to encode a message (e.g. a Packet), it is best to call this handler
 * an encoder. For example PacketEncoder.
