/**
 * A Channel is a construct that can send/receive like Packets/ClientMessages etc.
 * Connections use a channel to do the real work; but there is no dependency of the
 * com.hazelcast.internal.networking to a Connection (no cycles). This means that a
 * Channel can be used perfectly without Connection.
 *
 * The standard channel implementation is the
 * {@link com.hazelcast.internal.networking.nio.NioChannel} that uses TCP in combination
 * with selectors to transport data. In the future also other channel implementations
 * could be added, e.g. UDP based.
 *
 * Channel data is read using a {@link ChannelInboundHandler}. E.g data from a socket
 * is received and needs to get processed. The {@link ChannelInboundHandler} can convert
 * this to e.g. a Packet.
 *
 * Channel data is written using a {@link ChannelOutboundHandler}. E.g. a packet needs
 * to be converted to bytes.
 *
 * A Channel gets initialized using the {@link ChannelInitializer}.
 *
 * <h1>Future note</h1>
 * Below you can find some notes about the future of the Channel. This will hopefully
 * act as a guide how to move forward.
 *
 * <h2>Fragmentation</h2>
 * Packets are currently not fragmented, meaning that they are send as 1 atomic unit
 * and this can cause a 2 way communication blackout for operations (since either
 * operation or response can get blocked). Fragmentation needs to be added to make sure
 * the system doesn't suffer from head of line blocking.
 *
 * <h2>Ordering</h2>
 * In a channel messages don't need to remain ordered. Currently they are, but as soon as
 * we add packet fragmentation, packets can get out of order. Under certain conditions
 * you want to keep ordering, e.g. for events. In this case it should be possible
 * to have multiple streams in a channel. Within a stream there will be ordering.
 *
 * <h2>Reliability</h2>
 * A channel doesn't provide reliability. TCP/IP does provide reliability, but 1: who
 * says we want to keep using TCP/IP, but if a TCP/IP connection is lost and needs
 * to be re-established, packets are lost. Reliability can be added, just like TCP/IP
 * adds it; we don't discard the data until it has been acknowledged.
 *
 * <h2>Flow and congestion control</h2>
 * On the Channel level we have no flow of congestion control; frames are always accepted
 * no matter if on the sending side the write-queue is overloaded, or on the receiving side
 * the system is overloaded (e.g. many pending operations on the operation queue). Just like
 * with TCP/IP, flow and congestion control should be added.
 *
 * <h2>UDP</h2>
 * With ordering, reliability and flow and congestion control in place, we can ask
 * ourselves the question if UDP is not a more practical solution.
