/**
 * Reads content from a {@link ByteBuffer} and processes it. The ChannelInboundHandler is invoked by the {@link Channel} when
 * data has been read and requires processing.
 *
 * A typical example is that Packet instances are created from the buffered data and handing them over the the
 * {@link com.hazelcast.spi.impl.packetdispatcher.PacketDispatcher}. See {@link MemberChannelInboundHandler} for more information.
 *
 * {@link ChannelInboundHandler} are not required to be threadsafe. They should be able to retain state like flyweights and
 * other data, without worrying about synchronization.
 *
 * <h1>Pipelining & Encryption</h1>
 * The ChannelInboundHandler/ChannelOutboundHandler can also form a pipeline. For example for SSL there could be a initial
 * ChannelInboundHandler that decryption the ByteBuffer and passes the decrypted ByteBuffer to the next ChannelInboundHandler;
 * which could be a {@link MemberChannelInboundHandler} that reads out any Packet from the decrypted ByteBuffer. Using this
 * approach encryption can easily be added to any type of communication, not only member 2 member communication.
 *
 * Currently security is added by using a {@link Channel}, but this is not needed if the handlers form a pipeline.
 * Netty follows a similar approach with pipelining and adding encryption.
 *
 * There is no explicit support for setting up a 'pipeline' of ChannelInboundHandler/WriterHandlers but t can easily be realized
 * by setting up the chain and let a handler explicitly forward to the next. Since it isn't a common practice for the handler
 * so far, isn't needed to add additional complexity to the system; just set up a chain manually.
 *
 * pseudo code:
 * <pre>
 *     public class DecryptingReadHandler implements ChannelInboundHandler {
 *         private final ChannelInboundHandler next;
 *
 *         public DecryptingReadHandler(ChannelInboundHandler next) {
 *             this.next = next;
 *         }
 *
 *         public void onRead(ByteBuffer src) {
 *             decrypt(src, decryptedSrc);
 *             next.onRead(decryptedSrc)
 *         }
 *     }
 * </pre>
 * The <code>next</code> ChannelInboundHandler is the next item in the pipeline.
 *
 * For encryption is similar approach can be followed where the DecryptingWriteHandler is the last ChannelOutboundHandler in
 * the pipeline.
