/**
 * Reads content from a {@link ByteBuffer} and processes it. The ReadHandler is invoked by the {@link SocketReader} after
 * it has read data from the socket.
 *
 * A typical example is that Packet instances are created from the buffered data and handing them over the the
 * {@link com.hazelcast.spi.impl.packetdispatcher.PacketDispatcher}. See {@link MemberReadHandler} for more information.
 *
 * Each {@link SocketReader} will have its own {@link ReadHandler} instance. Therefor it doesn't need to be thread-safe.
 *
 * <h1>Pipelining & Encryption</h1>
 * The ReadHandler/WriteHandler can also form a pipeline. For example for SSL there could be a initial ReadHandler that decryption
 * the ByteBuffer and passes the decrypted ByteBuffer to the next ReadHandler; which could be a {@link MemberReadHandler}
 * that reads out any Packet from the decrypted ByteBuffer. Using this approach encryption can easily be added to any type of
 * communication, not only member 2 member communication.
 *
 * Currently security is added by using a {@link SocketChannelWrapper}, but this is not needed if the handlers form a pipeline.
 * Netty follows a similar approach with pipelining and adding encryption.
 *
 * There is no explicit support for setting up a 'pipeline' of ReadHandler/WriterHandlers but t can easily be realized by setting
 * up the chain and let a handler explicitly forward to the next. Since it isn't a common practice for the handler so far, isn't
 * needed to add additional complexity to the system; just set up a chain manually.
 *
 * pseudo code:
 * <pre>
 *     public class DecryptingReadHandler implements ReadHandler {
 *         private final ReadHandler next;
 *
 *         public DecryptingReadHandler(ReadHandler next) {
 *             this.next = next;
 *         }
 *
 *         public void read(ByteBuffer src) {
 *             decrypt(src, decryptedSrc);
 *             next.read(decryptedSrc)
 *         }
 *     }
 * </pre>
 * The <code>next</code> ReadHandler is the next item in the pipeline.
 *
 * For encryption is similar approach can be followed where the DecryptingWriteHandler is the last WriteHandler in the pipeline.
