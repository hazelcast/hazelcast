/**
 * Wraps a {@link java.nio.channels.SocketChannel}.
 *
 * The reason this class exists is because for enterprise encryption. Ideally the SocketChannel should have been decorated
 * with this encryption functionality, but unfortunately that isn't possible with this class.
 *
 * That is why a new 'wrapper' interface is introduced which acts like a SocketChannel and the implementations wrap a
 * SocketChannel.
 *
 * In the future we should get rid of this class and rely on {@link ReadHandler}/{@link WriteHandler} chaining to add encryption.
 * This will remove more artifacts from the architecture that can't carry their weight.
