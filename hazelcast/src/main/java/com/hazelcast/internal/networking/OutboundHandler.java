/**
 * The {@link OutboundHandler} is a {@link ChannelHandler} for outbound
 * traffic.
 *
 * An example is the PacketEncoder that takes packets from the src (Provider) and
 * encodes them to the dst (ByteBuffer).
 *
 * {@link OutboundHandler} instances are not expected to be thread-safe;
 * each channel will gets its own instance(s).
 *
 * A {@link OutboundHandler} is constructed through a {@link ChannelInitializer}.
 *
 * <h1>Buffer</h1>
 * The OutboundHandler is responsible for its own destination buffer
 * if it has one. So if needs to be compacted/flipped etc, it should take
 * care of that.
 *
 * If OutboundHandler has an destination buffer and the {@link #onWrite()}
 * is called, the first thing it should do is to call
 * {@link IOUtil#compactOrClear(ByteBuffer)} so it flips to
 * writing mode. And at the end of the onWrite method, the destination buffer
 * should be flipped into reading mode.
 *
 * If the OutboundHandler has a source buffer, it is expected to be
 * in reading mode and it is the responsibility of the OutboundHandler
 * in front to put that buffer in reading mode.
 *
 * @param <S> the type of the source. E.g. a ByteBuffer or a
 *            {@link java.util.function.Supplier}.
 * @param <D> the type of the destination. E.g. a ByteBuffer or a
 *            {@link java.util.function.Consumer}.
