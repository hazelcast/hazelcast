/**
 * Contains adapter and utility classes needed to adapt YAML DOM classes
 * as W3C DOM ones, making config builders that accept W3C DOM able to
 * build the config structure from YAML.
 * <p>
 * This package intentionally lacks fully implementing the  functionality
 * of the W3C DOM model. Only the parts that required by the Hazelcast
 * config processors are implemented.
 * <p>
 * The package contains the following adapters:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link com.hazelcast.internal.yaml.YamlNode} to {@link org.w3c.dom.Node}</li>
 * <li>{@link com.hazelcast.internal.yaml.YamlCollection} to {@link org.w3c.dom.NodeList}</li>
 * <li>{@link com.hazelcast.internal.yaml.YamlMapping} to {@link org.w3c.dom.NamedNodeMap}</li>
 * </ul>
