/**
 * Represents async requests sent from Management Center.
 * <p/>
 * Normally, ManagementCenterService handles {@code ConsoleRequest}s synchronously
 * on its {@code TaskPollThread}, a single thread polls tasks from Management Center,
 * executes them and writes back the response directly. This is fine for short running tasks
 * but for long running tasks or blocking invocations, it's required to offload request
 * handling to an async thread pool. Otherwise, {@code TaskPollThread} will be blocked
 * for a long time without handling any request from Management Center.
