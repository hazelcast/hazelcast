/**
 * A list that contains probes. The probes are sorted based on their names.
 *
 * It also contains the modCount so that the system can determine when the SortedProbeInstance needs to be refreshed.
 *
 * It can be that the SortedProbeInstance contains ProbeInstance that are created after the modCount is increased
 * (so the modCount) could be to old. When this happens a subsequent call to render will get the SortedProbeInstances
 * refreshed; now with a newer modcount (and potentially the same probes).
 *
 * This structure is effectively immutable. After it is created, it won't change.
