/**
 * A Metric is a 'quantitative measure' of something for example the number of
 * operations pending, number of operations per second being executed etc.
 *
 * Each metric is uniquely identified using a name. See {@link #getName()}.
 *
 * A metric gets its content from a probe. An probe can be one of the following:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>a method with the {@link Probe} annotation</li>
 *     <li>a field with the {@link Probe} annotation</li>
 *     <li>a {@link LongProbeFunction}</li>
 *     <li>a {@link DoubleProbeFunction}</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * If the Metric is obtained before a probe is registered, the Metric is without
 * probe. As long as no probe is available, every time the metrics needs a value,
 * it will look up the probe in the {@link MetricsRegistry}.
