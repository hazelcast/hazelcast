/**
 * The MetricsRegistry is responsible for recording all kinds of Hazelcast/JVM specific information to
 * help out with issues like performance or stability problems.
 *
 * Each HazelcastInstance has its own MetricsRegistry instance.
 *
 * A MetricsRegistry can contain many {@link Probe} instances. A probe is registered under a certain name,
 * and can be read by creating a Gauge, see {@link #newLongGauge(String)}.
 *
 * This name can be any string, e.g.:
 * <ol>
 * <li>proxy.count</li>
 * <li>operation.completed.count</li>
 * <li>operation.partition[14].count</li>
 * </ol>
 * For the time being there the MetricsRegistry doesn't require any syntax for the name content; so any String is fine.
 *
 * <h1>Duplicate Registrations</h1>
 * The MetricsRegistry is lenient regarding duplicate registrations of probes. So if there is an existing probe for a
 * given name and a new probe with the same name is registered, the old probe is overwritten. The reason to be lenient
 * is that the MetricRegistry should not throw exception. Of course there will be a log warning.
 *
 * <h1>Performance</h1>
 * The MetricRegistry is designed for low overhead probes. So once a probe is registered, there is no overhead
 * for the provider of the probe data. The provider could have for example a volatile long field and increment
 * this using a lazy-set. As long as the MetricRegistry can frequently read out this field, the MetricRegistry
 * is perfectly happy with such low overhead probes. So it is up to the provider of the probe
 * how much overhead is required.

     * depend on the order of registration. Perhaps you want to read out e.g. operations.count gauge, but the OperationService
     * has not started yet and the metric is not yet available. Another cause is that perhaps a probe is not registered, but

     * implementation, that doesn't provide the operation.count probe.
