/**
 * The MetricsRegistry is a registry of various Hazelcast/JVM internal
 * information to help out with debugging, performance or stability issues.
 * Each HazelcastInstance has one local MetricsRegistry instance.
 * <p>
 * A MetricsRegistry can contain many {@link Probe} instances. A probe is
 * registered under a name, and can be read by creating a {@link Gauge}, see
 * {@link #newLongGauge(String)}.
 * <p>
 * The metrics registry doesn't interpret the name in any way, it is treated as
 * is. For example, {@code [tag1=foo,tag2=bar]} and {@code [tag2=bar,tag1=foo]}
 * will be treated as two different metrics even though they have same tags and
 * values. Clients making use of the metrics can use the tags. For backwards
 * compatibility, the name does not have to be enclosed in {@code []}.
 *
 * <h3>Duplicate Registrations</h3> The MetricsRegistry is lenient regarding
 * duplicate registrations of probes. So if there is an existing probe for a
 * given name and a new probe with the same name is registered, the old probe
 * is overwritten. The reason to be lenient is that the MetricRegistry should
 * not throw exception. Of course, there will be a log warning.
 *
 * <h3>Performance</h3> The MetricRegistry is designed for low overhead probes.
 * So once a probe is registered, there is no overhead for the provider of the
 * probe data. The provider could have for example a volatile long field and
 * increment this using a lazy-set. As long as the MetricRegistry can
 * frequently read out this field, the MetricRegistry is perfectly happy with
 * such low overhead probes. So it is up to the provider of the probe how much
 * overhead is required.
 *
 * <h3>Static and dynamic metrics</h3> The MetricRegistry collects metrics
 * from static and dynamic metrics sources, these metrics are referred to as
 * static and dynamic metrics.
 * <p/>
 * The static metrics are the ones that are registered once and cannot be
 * removed during the lifetime of the given Hazelcast instance. These are
 * typically system metrics either Hazelcast or JVM/OS ones.
 * <p/>
 * The dynamic metrics are collected dynamically during each collection cycle
 * via the {@link DynamicMetricsProvider} interface. Typical examples for the
 * dynamic metrics are the metrics exposed by the distributed data structures
 * that can be created and destroyed dynamically.
 * <p/>
 * The MetricsRegistry doesn't cache the dynamic metrics, therefore the dynamic
 * metrics don't increase the heap live set. In exchange, they may allocate
 * during the collection cycle. It is therefore the responsibility of the
 * dynamic metric sources to keep allocation low.

     * registration. Perhaps you want to read out e.g. operations.count gauge,
     * but the OperationService has not started yet and the metric is not yet
     * available. Another cause is that perhaps a probe is not registered, but
     * the metric is created. For example when experimenting with a new
     * implementation, e.g. a new OperationService implementation, that doesn't
     * provide the operation.count probe.
