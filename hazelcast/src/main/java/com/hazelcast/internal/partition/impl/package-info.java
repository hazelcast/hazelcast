/**
 * Contains the actual implementation of the {@link com.hazelcast.internal.partition.InternalPartitionService}.
 *
 * It is very important that should be the least amount of dependencies to this package. Preferably only the
 * {@link com.hazelcast.internal.partition.impl.InternalPartitionServiceImpl} is called while constructing an instance and after
 * that all communication should go through the {@link com.hazelcast.internal.partition.InternalPartitionService} interface.
 *
 * Nobody needs to know about the actual implementing classes because this gives a very tight coupling and
 * this is undesirable. This is not only undesirable for external people because they could easily be tightly
 * coupled to the internals of Hazelcast, but it also is undesirable for us because it becomes a tangled mess
 * that prevent easy replacement/changes.
