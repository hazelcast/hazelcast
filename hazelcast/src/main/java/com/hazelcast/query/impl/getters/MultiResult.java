/**
 * Represents multiple results from a single attribute extraction.
 * <p/>
 * MultiResult is an aggregate of results that is returned if the ValueExtractor returns multiple results due to a
 * reduce operation executed on a hierarchy of values.
 * <p/>
 * It sounds counter-intuitive, but a single extraction may return multiple values when arrays or collections are
 * involved.
 * <p/>
 * Let's have a look at the following data structure:
 * <code>
 * class Swap {
 * Leg legs[2];
 * }
 * <p/>
 * class Leg {
 * String currency;
 * }
 * </code>
 * <p/>
 * The following extraction of the currency attribute <code>legs[any].currency</code> results in two currencies for each
 * Leg. In order to return both values in one result of the extract operation both currencies are returned in a
 * single MultiResult object where each result contains a name of the currency.
 * It allows the user to operate on multiple "reduced" values as if they were single-values.
 * <p/>
 * Let's have a look at the following queries:
 * <ul>
 * <li>leg[1].currency   = 'EUR'</li>
 * <li>leg[any].currency = 'EUR'</li>
 * <p/>
 * </ul>
 * In the first query, the extraction will return just one currency, whereas the extraction in the second query will
 * return a MultiResult containing two currencies.
 * During the evaluation of the "=" equals predicate the MultiResult will be "unfolded" and the condition will
 * evaluated against all currencies from the MultiResult. If there is "any" currency that matches the condition the
 * whole predicate will be evaluated to "true" and the matching Swap will be returned.
 * As a result all Swaps will be returned where there's at lease one Leg with EUR currency.
 * <p/>
 * Other examples:
 * legs -> returns one 'single-value' result -> a collection of values
 * legs[0] -> returns one 'single result' - a Leg object
 * legs[0].currency -> returns one 'multi value' result - an array of Legs
 * legs[any] -> returns a MultiResult - that contains a collection of Leg objects
 * legs[any].currency -> returns a MultiResult - that contains a collection of String objects
 *
 * @param <T> type of the underlying result store in the MultiResult

     *
     * Allows differentiating whether there is a null value in the MultiResult
     * that is a result of a null or empty target in the expression.
     *
     * For query evaluation the difference is not important - and we need to return null in both cases there.
     * For aggregations it makes a difference and we need this context knowledge there.
