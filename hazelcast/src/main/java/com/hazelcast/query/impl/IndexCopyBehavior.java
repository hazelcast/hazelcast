/**
 * Defines the behavior for index copying on index read/write.
 *
 * Supported in BINARY and OBJECT in-memory-formats. Ignored in NATIVE in-memory-format.
 *
 * Why is it needed? In order to support correctness the internal data-structures used by indexes need to do some copying.
 * The copying may take place on-read or on-write:
 *
 * -> Copying on-read means that each index-read operation will copy the result of the query before returning it to the caller.
 * This copying may be expensive, depending on the size of the result, since the result is stored in a map, which means
 * that all entries need to have the hash calculated before being stored in a bucket.
 * Each index-write operation however will be fast, since there will be no copying taking place.
 *
 * -> Copying on-write means that each index-write operation will completely copy the underlying map to provide the
 * copy-on-write semantics. Depending on the index size, it may be a very expensive operation.
 * Each index-read operation will be very fast, however, since it may just access the map and return it to the caller.
 *
 * -> Never copying is tricky. It means that the internal data structures of the index are concurrently modified without
 * copy-on-write semantics. Index reads never copy the results of a query to a separate map.
 * It means that the results backed by the underlying index-map can change after the query has been executed.
 * Specifically an entry might have been added / removed from an index, or it might have been remapped.
 * Should be used in cases when a the caller expects "mostly correct" results - specifically, if it's ok
 * if some entries returned in the result set do not match the initial query criteria.
 * The fastest solution for read and writes, since no copying takes place.
 *
 * It's a tuneable trade-off - the user may decide.
