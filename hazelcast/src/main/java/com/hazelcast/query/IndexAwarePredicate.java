/**
 * Extends the {@link Predicate} interface with the ability to support indexes.
 * <p>
 * The general contract is:
 * <ul>
 * <li>While performing a query, the query engine invokes the {@link #isIndexed}
 * method of the index-aware predicate and provides it with the
 * {@link QueryContext} instance. The predicate may consult the passed query
 * context regarding the indexes configured for the map in question and decide
 * whether it is possible to use the indexes to speed up the query processing or
 * not.
 * <li>If the predicate decides to use the indexes, its {@link #filter} method
 * is invoked by the query engine to obtain a filtered entry set. The query
 * engine assumes that this obtained result set is consistent with the entry set
 * at the time the result set was produced. In other words, all the entries for
 * which the predicate {@link #apply evaluates} to {@code true} are included in
 * the result set and all the entries for which the predicate evaluates to
 * {@code false} are excluded from the result set.
 * <li>If the predicate decides <i>not</i> to use indexes, the query engine
 * produces the result set on its own and evaluates the predicate for every
 * entry by invoking the {@link #apply} method of the predicate.
 * </ul>
 *
 * @param <K> the type of keys the predicate operates on.
 * @param <V> the type of values the predicate operates on.
