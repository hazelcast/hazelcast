/**
 * Common interface for CRDT (conflict-free replicated data type)
 * implementations.
 * The common behaviour for all implementations is that they have a strong
 * eventual consistency property - two nodes that have received the same
 * set of updates, possibly in a different order, will have an identical
 * shared state and any conflicting updates are merged automatically.
 * All operations on the CRDT implementations are performed locally without
 * any coordination with the other replicas of the same data. This allows
 * for higher availability but can present data loss in some scenarios,
 * e.g. the node is killed right after it receives an update. In split
 * brain scenarios, each replica should keep it's local state and once the
 * split brain is healed, the state of the replicas that were unreachable
 * during split brain as well as the local state will converge to the same
 * state.
 * The CRDT state can be versioned in which case it will increase the
 * version number on each mutation. This way, the replication mechanism
 * will be able to replicate only those states which have not yet been
 * replicated and avoid replication in a quiescent state.
