/**
 * Service that handles replication and migration of CRDT data for all CRDT
 * implementations.
 * The CRDT implementations for which it performs replication and migration
 * must implement {@link CRDTReplicationAwareService}.
 * <p>
 * The replication is performed periodically on an executor with the name
 * {@value #CRDT_REPLICATION_MIGRATION_EXECUTOR}. You may configure this
 * executor accordingly.
 * The migration mechanism uses the same executor but it is performed only
 * on membership changes and on CRDT state merge. The migration checks are
 * triggered on CRDT state merge because CRDT states can get merged when
 * a replica is shutting down and it is trying to replicate any previously
 * unreplicated state to any member in the cluster, regardless of the
 * configured replica count.
