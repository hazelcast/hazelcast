/**
 * PN (Positive-Negative) CRDT counter.
 * <p>
 * The counter supports adding and subtracting values as well as
 * retrieving the current counter value.
 * Each replica of this counter can perform operations locally without
 * coordination with the other replicas, thus increasing availability.
 * The counter guarantees that whenever two nodes have received the
 * same set of updates, possibly in a different order, their state is
 * identical, and any conflicting updates are merged automatically.
 * If no new updates are made to the shared state, all nodes that can
 * communicate will eventually have the same data.
 * <p>
 * The updates to this counter are applied locally when invoked on a
 * CRDT replica. A replica can be any hazelcast instance which is not a
 * client or a lite member. The number of replicas in the cluster is
 * determined by the {@link PNCounterConfig#getReplicaCount()} configuration
 * value.
 * <p>
 * When invoking updates from non-replica instance, the invocation is remote.
 * This may lead to indeterminate state - the update may be applied but the
 * response has not been received. In this case, the caller will be notified
 * with a {@link com.hazelcast.spi.exception.TargetDisconnectedException}
 * when invoking from a client or a
 * {@link com.hazelcast.core.MemberLeftException} when invoked from a member.
 * <p>
 * The read and write methods provide monotonic read and RYW (read-your-write)
 * guarantees. These guarantees are session guarantees which means that if
 * no replica with the previously observed state is reachable, the session
 * guarantees are lost and the method invocation will throw a
 * {@link ConsistencyLostException}. This does not mean
 * that an update is lost. All of the updates are part of some replica and
 * will be eventually reflected in the state of all other replicas. This
 * exception just means that you cannot observe your own writes because
 * all replicas that contain your updates are currently unreachable.
 * After you have received a {@link ConsistencyLostException}, you can either
 * wait for a sufficiently up-to-date replica to become reachable in which
 * case the session can be continued or you can reset the session by calling
 * the {@link #reset()} method. If you have called the {@link #reset()} method,
 * a new session is started with the next invocation to a CRDT replica.
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE:</b>
 * The CRDT state is kept entirely on non-lite (data) members. If there
 * aren't any and the methods here are invoked on a lite member, they will
 * fail with an {@link NoDataMemberInClusterException}.
