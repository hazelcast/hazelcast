/**
 * A {@link IOThreadingModel} that uses (busy) spinning on the SocketChannels to see if there is something
 * to read or write.
 *
 * Currently there are 2 threads spinning:
 * <ol>
 * <li>1 thread spinning on all SocketChannels for reading</li>
 * <li>1 thread spinning on all SocketChannels for writing</li>
 * </ol>
 * In the future we need to play with this a lot more. 1 thread should be able to saturate a 40GbE connection, but that
 * currently doesn't work for us. So I guess our IO threads are doing too much stuff not relevant like writing the Frames
 * to bytebuffers or converting the bytebuffers to Frames.
 *
 * This is an experimental feature and disabled by default.
