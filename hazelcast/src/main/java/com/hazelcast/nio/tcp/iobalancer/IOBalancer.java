/**
 * It attempts to detect and fix a selector imbalance problem.
 *
 * By default Hazelcast uses 3 threads to read data from TCP connections and 3 threads to write data to connections.
 * We have measured significant fluctuations of performance when the threads are not utilized equally.
 *
 * <code>com.hazelcast.nio.tcp.handlermigration.HandlerBalancer</code> tries to detect such situations and fix
 * them by moving {@link com.hazelcast.nio.tcp.ReadHandler} and {@link com.hazelcast.nio.tcp.WriteHandler} between
 * threads.
 *
 * It measures number of events serviced by each handler in a given interval and if imbalance is detected then it
 * schedules handler migration to fix the situation. The exact migration strategy can be customized via
 * {@link com.hazelcast.nio.tcp.iobalancer.MigrationStrategy}.
 *
 * Measuring interval can be customized via {@link com.hazelcast.instance.GroupProperties#IO_BALANCER_INTERVAL_SECONDS}
 *
 * It doesn't leverage {@link com.hazelcast.nio.ConnectionListener} capability
 * provided by {@link com.hazelcast.nio.ConnectionManager} to observe connections as it has to be notified
 * right after a physical TCP connection is created whilst <code>ConnectionListener</code> is notified only
 * after a successful (Hazelcast) binding process.
