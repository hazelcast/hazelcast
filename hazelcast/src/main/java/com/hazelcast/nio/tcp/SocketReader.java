/**
 * The SocketReader is responsible for reading data from the socket, on behalf of a connection, into a
 * {@link java.nio.ByteBuffer}. Once the data is read into the ByteBuffer, this ByteBuffer is passed to the {@link ReadHandler}
 * that takes care of the actual processing of the incoming data.
 *
 * Each {@link TcpIpConnection} has its own {@link SocketReader} instance.
 *
 * There are many different flavors of SocketReader:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>reader for member to member communication</li>
 *     <li>reader for (old and new) client to member communication</li>
 *     <li>reader for encrypted member to member communication</li>
 *     <li>reader for REST/Memcached</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * A SocketReader is tightly coupled to the threading model; so a SocketReader instance is created using
 * {@link IOThreadingModel#newSocketReader(TcpIpConnection)}.
 *
 * Before Hazelcast 3.6 the name of this interface was ReadHandler.
