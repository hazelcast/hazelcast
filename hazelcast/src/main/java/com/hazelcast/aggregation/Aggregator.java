 * Base class for all aggregators. Exposes API for parallel two-phase aggregations:

 * - combining all aggregators into one to calculate the final result
 * <p>
 * Aggregator does not have to be thread-safe.
 * accumulate() and combine() calls may be interwoven.
 * <p>
 * The very instance passed to an aggregate() method will not be used at all. It is just a prototype object
 * that will be cloned using serialization, since each partition gets its own instance of an aggregator.
 * In this way the aggregator is not used by multiple-threads. Each thread gets its own aggregator instance.
