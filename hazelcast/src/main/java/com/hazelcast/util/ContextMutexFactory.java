/**
 * Provides reference-counted mutexes suitable for synchronization in the context of a supplied object.
 * <p>
 * Context objects and their associated mutexes are stored in a {@link Map}. Client code is responsible to invoke
 * {@link Mutex#close()} on the obtained {@link Mutex} after having synchronized on the mutex; failure to do so
 * will leave an entry residing in the internal {@link Map} which may have adverse effects on the ability to garbage
 * collect the context object and the mutex.
 * <p>
 * The returned {@link Mutex}es implement {@link Closeable}, so can be conveniently used in a try-with-resources statement.
 * <p>
 * Typical usage would allow, for example, synchronizing access to a {@link java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap} on a
 * per-key basis, to avoid blocking other threads which could perform updates on other entries of the {@link Map}.
