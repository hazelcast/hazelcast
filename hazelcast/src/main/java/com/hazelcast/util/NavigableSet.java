/**
 * A {@link SortedSet} extended with navigation methods reporting
 * closest matches for given search targets. Methods {@code lower},
 * {@code floor}, {@code ceiling}, and {@code higher} return elements
 * respectively less than, less than or equal, greater than or equal,
 * and greater than a given element, returning {@code null} if there
 * is no such element.  A {@code NavigableSet} may be accessed and
 * traversed in either ascending or descending order.  The {@code
 * descendingSet} method returns a view of the set with the senses of
 * all relational and directional methods inverted. The performance of
 * ascending operations and views is likely to be faster than that of
 * descending ones.  This interface additionally defines methods
 * {@code pollFirst} and {@code pollLast} that return and remove the
 * lowest and highest element, if one exists, else returning {@code
 * null}.  Methods {@code subSet}, {@code headSet},
 * and {@code tailSet} differ from the like-named {@code
 * SortedSet} methods in accepting additional arguments describing
 * whether lower and upper bounds are inclusive versus exclusive.
 * Subsets of any {@code NavigableSet} must implement the {@code
 * NavigableSet} interface.
 * <p/>
 * <p> The return values of navigation methods may be ambiguous in
 * implementations that permit {@code null} elements. However, even
 * in this case the result can be disambiguated by checking
 * {@code contains(null)}. To avoid such issues, implementations of
 * this interface are encouraged to <em>not</em> permit insertion of
 * {@code null} elements. (Note that sorted sets of {@link
 * Comparable} elements intrinsically do not permit {@code null}.)
 * <p/>
 * <p>Methods
 * {@link #subSet(Object, Object) subSet(E, E)},
 * {@link #headSet(Object) headSet(E)}, and
 * {@link #tailSet(Object) tailSet(E)}
 * are specified to return {@code SortedSet} to allow existing
 * implementations of {@code SortedSet} to be compatibly retrofitted to
 * implement {@code NavigableSet}, but extensions and implementations
 * of this interface are encouraged to override these methods to return
 * {@code NavigableSet}.
