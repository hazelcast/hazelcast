1. New Features

The following are the new features introduced with 3.8 release.

Hazelcast Enterprise Features

- Rolling Member Upgrades for Minor Releases: You can upgrade your Hazelcast members to the next minor release without service interruption. Please refer to the Rolling Member Upgrades chapter.
- Restore Hot Restart Data in a Different Cluster: You will be able to restore Hot Restart data on a completely new cluster with different IP addresses or on a cluster of machines formed by existing and new IP addresses. Since this is a removal of a restriction or limitation, nothing will change for current Hot Restart Store users. Please refer to the Moving/Copying Hot Restart Data section.

Hazelcast Open Source Features

- Continuous Query Cache: With this release, the previously Enterprise feature Continuous Query Cache becomes open source. Please refer to the Continuous Query Cache section.
- Cardinality Estimator: Cardinality Estimator data structure is implemented on top of Hazelcast to estimate cardinality. Please refer to the Cardinality Estimator Service section.
- Scheduled Executor Service: Distributed implementation of Java's ScheduledExecutorService API. Please refer to the Scheduled Executor Service section.
- User Code Deployment: Load your new classes to Hazelcast IMDG members dynamically without restarting all of them.

2. Enhancements

This section lists the enhancements performed for Hazelcast 3.8 and 3.8x releases.

*3.8.1 Enhancements*

- Mutual authentication with TLS certificates: It allows the clients also to have their keyStores and members to have their trustStores so that the members can know which clients they can trust.

*3.8 Enhancements*

- Fast Aggregations for Queries: Please refer to Fast Aggregations section.
- Projections for Queries: Please refer to Projections section.
- Eventually Consistent Near Cache: With this improvement, possible losses of invalidation events are detected and stale reads are prevented. Please refer to the Near Cache Eventual Consistency section.
- Cluster Split-Brain Protection for Queue and Lock: Split-brain protection is now available for the queue and lock data structures. Please refer to the sections Lock Split-Brain Protection and Queue Split-Brain Protection.
- Unified Near Cache Implementation: Different near cache implementations for JCache, map, client side and member side are unified. You can refer to the Near Cache section.
- High Performance Near Cache: A near cache preloader is introduced to preserve the information about which keys are used in a populated near cache. You can refer to the Near Cache Preloader section.
- `removeAll(predicate)` for Map: You can remove all map entries that match your predicate. You can refer to the Removing Bulk Map Entries with Predicates section.
- Ringbuffer with Persistent Datastore: Implemented for the Ringbuffer which is similar to the existing queue store mechanism. Please refer to Ringbuffer with Persistent Datastore section.
- Hazelcast Striim Hot Cache Adapter: Hot Cache functionality based on Striim's Change Data Capture (CDC) for the underlying database updates. Please note that this enhancement is available for Hazelcast Enterprise. Please refer to the Hazelcast Striim Hot Cache section.
- One-off WAN Synchronization with Dynamically Added Endpoint: Improvement to allow copying the maps' all content to a target cluster dynamically in runtime. Please note that this enhancement is available for Hazelcast Enterprise.
- Hot Restart Usability Improvements: When a cluster with Hot Restart enabled is restarted, it starts in the ACTIVE state. Please note that this enhancement is available for Hazelcast Enterprise. Please refer to the Hot Restart Types section.
- Hot Restart with Incomplete Members: The restart procedure for a cluster having Hot Restart enabled is now more flexible by allowing you to do a partial start, which basically means that once the cluster is shutdown, it can be restarted with some missing members. Please note that this enhancement is available for Hazelcast Enterprise. Please refer to the Partial Start section.
- Copy Hot Restart Store data from Source to Target: You can copy Hot Restart Store data from a running cluster to a target without shutting down the source cluster. Please note that this enhancement is available for Hazelcast Enterprise. Please refer to the Hot Backup section.
- Improvement in WAN Queue Full Behavior: Now, Hazelcast throws an exception when the queue is full and replication is active, unless it is stopped on the Management Center. Please note that this enhancement is available for Hazelcast Enterprise. Please refer to the Queue Full Behavior section.


The following are the other improvements performed to solve the enhancement issues opened by the Hazelcast customers/team.

- Tests are needed to prove that removeAll does not deserialize portables. [9474]
- Client support for distributed scheduled executor service. [9385]
- When a member without JCache service joins a cluster where JCache service is enabled but not used, the member should not fail. [9301]
- It would be nice to have names assigned to all threads created by Hazelcast (and not the default ones, e.g., pool-2-thread-1, pool-2-thread-2). [9210]
- There should be a more detailed and clarifying information in the diagnostics of PartitionIteratingOperation. [8855]
- When there is no access to NodeEngine, the logger should be able to be used from a static context without any side effects to the logging configuration. [8760]
- Client tasks should be bounced back when a member has not completely start yet. [8715]
- A method size(Predicate) should be added to determine the size of predicate results. [8555]
- Currently the property com.hazelcast.map.impl.eviction.ExpirationManager.PERIOD is hard-coded to 5 seconds. Making it a configurable property will help in tuning the eviction. [8277]
- The method com.hazelcast.topic.impl.TopicProxy#publish serializes the message even if the message is never sent due to having no subscribers. In the case of non-global-ordering and non-client use, the implementation should defer serialization until it has established that there are subscribers. [8262]
- Hazelcast should provide an abstract Mapper implementation which invokes the Supplier given to Aggregation#getMapper(). [7477]
- Configuration setting for WAN replication queue should be only for primary entries. [7124]
- Currently if you want to use Container-Managed Transactions with Hazelcast within a JEE Application Server, you need to use the provided JCA Adapter. This JCA Adapter creates a Hazelcast instance. This should be allowed: configuration of the JCA Adapter to be either Server or Client-based. [5667]
- Currently PartitionIteratingOperation consumes a generic operation thread, while the operations for the partitions are running. This means that the generic thread pool can dry out and this can cause a lot of problems for important tasks that cannot be executed since the thread pool is empty. A PartitionIteratingService should be introduced where the system can lookup TraceableOperations. [4889]
- Hazelcast Shutdown Hook calls the method terminate() instead of shutdown(). [4648]
- Hazelcast should support ScheduledExecutorService. [115]

3. Fixes

This section lists the fixed issues for Hazelcast 3.8 and 3.8.x releases.

*3.8.1 Fixes*

- `BackupEntryProcessor` returned from `AbstractEntryProcessor` does not support `HazelcastInstanceAware`. [10083]
- Updates performed with IMap's putTransient method should trigger EntryUpdatedListener. [10077]
- Missing documentation for configuring log4j2 as logging framework. [9970]
- Management Center section in the Reference Manual is misleading when it explains tool's behavior for clusters having more than two members. [9969]
- JCache bootstrap should have a way to reconciliate the existing `HazelcastInstance`. [9958]
- Multicast configuration's trusted-interfaces element is not handled properly on startup of the members. [9953]
- For Hazelcast 3.7.*, MigrationListener's migrationStarted and migrationCompleted methods are called for all partitions. [9919]
- While performing async operations test, OOME is thrown due to exceeding garbage collection overhead, at the client side. [9665]
- Behavior of aggregators when extracted value is null should be well-documented. [9858]
- Hazelcast Java client disconnects from the cluster with heartbeat problems. [8956]
- Currently the near cache updates does not guarantee the order of events for a certain key. The updates are performed via asynchronous executor runs and it does not guarantee the order of updates. Furthermore, the invalidations via event service is also not ordered. [8652]
- Client's near cache implementation uses userExecutor which is also used for other purposes such as making callbacks to lifecycle listeners. A client may block an operation of the near cache updates by a slow lifecycle listener. This needs to be addressed. [8651]
- Client has a configurable hazelcast.client.max.concurrent.invocations property which limits the outstanding client requests. It is observed that at some cases, for async calls, it is possible that this limit may not work as expected and this may cause outstanding requests to grow which may cause OOM. [8568]
- When using a Hazelcast Client instance, if the redoOperation is set to true, operations which failed to be sent to the cluster are retried, but failures from executing the operation itself in the cluster are not. [8545]
- While updating the Hazelcast maps in the clustered environment, the exception TargetNotMember is thrown. [7584]

*3.8 Fixes*

- Ordering consistency for the the method `writePortable` should be explained in the Reference Manual. [9813]
- A client cannot add index to map using Portable values without registering Portable classes on member. [9808]
- Index is not updated after entry processors change values. [9801]
- When using Entry Processor and index on a field the Entry Processor uses, wrong data is returned when executing a Predicate. [9798]
- `NullPointerException` in `LockServiceImpl`: an NPE is thrown in `LockServiceImpl` when creating one map with a quorum configuration (which activates the `QuorumServiceImpl` for all `QuorumAware` operations) and then calling a `QuorumAware` operation on another data structure without a quorum configuration. [9792]
- `ClusterVersion` is missing convenience methods for comparing easily. [9789]
- When scheduling tasks with multiple executors, calling `getAllScheduled` on one of them returns tasks scheduled per member but for all executors, rather than for the one we called the `getAllScheduled` from. [9784]
- There are too many log entries when quorum is not present. [9781]
- When `storeAll`/`deleteAll` methods are used in the MapStore interface, it is possible that the underlying implementation has stored/deleted some entries from the supplied batch and then gets an exception on some particular entry in the middle of the batch. In order to handle this scenario properly the MapStore could remove from the supplied batch entries which were properly stored in the underlying persistent store. The only thing to improve in the `DefaultWiteBehindProcessor` is to properly synchronize the map passed to `processBatch` method with the initial `batchMap`. [9733]
- If `hazelcast.discovery.enabled` on the client side: If neither `DiscoveryServiceProvider` nor `DiscoveryStrategyConfig` is specified, an NPE is thrown. A more helpful exception should be provided. [9722]
- The hazelcast-all.jar, which is the one included in Hazelcast Docker, downloaded from Maven repo, contains an outdated version of hazelcast-aws library. [9698]
- When scheduling on random partitions and trying to get all the scheduled tasks from the service, the number of tasks is wrong. The returned figure seems to match "num_of_tasks * backup_count". [9694]
- When a scheduled Callable/Runnable throws an exception, invoking future.get() on the client side does not throw the expected ExecutionException. [9685]
- The client is not updating listener registrations when the member restarts with a new version. [9677]
- IScheduledExecutorService does not use HazelcastInstanceAware on local operations. [9675]
- Near cache compatibility with 3.7 clients is broken for TTL expirations. [9674]
- Replicated Map configured with `async-fillup` as `false` prevents further members from joining the cluster. Members are stuck in an endless loop. [9592]
- When an exception is thrown from an `InitializingObject`'s initialize method, it is logged in WARNING level but then swallowed and the proxy object is added to the `ProxyRegistry`. Instead, the exception should result in removing the object from the `ProxyRegistry`, as it is already done for exceptions thrown from `service.createDistributedObject`. [9578]
- Near cache pre-loader fails when invalidations are enabled. [9536]
- There is a memory leak in `MetaDataGenerator` when (1) near cache invalidations are enabled, (2) map/cache is created and destroyed, and (3) the map name is stays referenced from `MetaDataGenerator`. [9495]
- JCache client needs access to CacheLoader implementation to work. [9453]
- The matching wildcard is strict, but no declaration can be found for element hz:hazelcast. [9406]
- "Connection Reset" warning shows up in the class `CloudyUtility`. [9404]
- Key state marking in near cached `getAll` should be improved. Instead of key based marking, partition based approach can be used. [9403]
- Scheduled executor service tests are too slow. [9386]
- The method getAll is not updating the localMapStats. [9373]
- Hazelcast 3.7.3 and Spring Boot 1.4.2 get the error PortableFactory[-22] is already registered. [9353]
- There is an issue when integrating with WebLogic 12c. Classloading logging should be added when DefaultNodeExtension is loaded by multiple classloaders. [9291]
- The method MapLoader.loadAll(true) does not reload after reloading with new keys. [9255]
- Problems with timeout in blocking calls. [9250]
- Stale reads from Map inside a transaction should be guaranteed, when Near Cache and delayed MapStore are enabled. [9248]
- Client protocol cannot handle "null"s in the collection. [9240]
- `LifecycleState` events are not received when Hazelcast docker image is used. [9189]
- If there is no network, multicast socket exception is thrown. [9081]
- Hazelcast is not handling XML configuration attribute for DurableExecutorService. [9078]
- If `DurableExecutorService.retrieveResult(long)` is run from a client for a task that does not exist, two exceptions appear at the client side. At the member side, it logs `StaleTaskIdException`. This should not be logged to the member if re-thrown to the client. [9051]
- When retrieving data from Java Hazelcast instance, `HazelcastSerializationException` is thrown from the .NET client. [8985]
- Callback for time to live (for map eviction) is invoked with a significant delay. [8894]
- "Warning 2" in IMap::tryRemove method's code comments is not correct. This method returns only a boolean. [8884]
- There are too many log messages when members of a cluster are not joined to another cluster (multicast) having a different group name in Hazelcast 3.6 and 3.7, which is already expected. [8867]
- When clients lose connection to the members in the cluster, even after the clients are reconnected to the cluster, the Entry/Message Listeners are never fired again. [8847]
- Nested queries on VersionedPortables with different versions cannot be performed. Hazelcast throws IllegalArgumentException. [8846]
- Fixed max-size value behavior for Near Cache configuration. If you set 0 for the max-size, now, it is valued as Integer.MAX_VALUE as expected and documented. [8826]
- While generating the XML string from a configuration object in ConfigXmlGenerator.generate() method, native-memory configuration is not appended to the result string. This causes the native-memory configuration for members not to be shown on the Management Center. [8825]
- "Client heartbeat is timed out , closing connection" warning shows up indefinitely on AWS. [8777]
- Spring XML configuration: The smart routing attribute defaults to false while the documentation says it defaults to true. [8746]
- Distributed objects present in the cluster do not show the same values. [8743]
- In Hazelcast 3.6.3, the error Current thread is not owner of the lock shows up when using Hazelcast client to perform the actions. [8730]
- There is an unchecked `CancelledKeyException` when client disconnects from the cluster. [8681]
- Bulk get operation with 100 keys fails. [8535]
- An `IllegalThreadStateException` may be thrown sometimes on a member of a cluster with two or more members when a Hazelcast client creates a new map with configured indexes. This exception is not thrown when indexes are created programmatically. [8492]
- Group and password attributes in Hibernate integration module should be validated. [7978]
- There appears to be an inconsistency where JCache uses the EvictionConfig object, but IMap directly uses properties of the NearCacheConfig. [7788]
- Topic listeners are lost after merging from a split-brain scenario. [7742]
- Member attributes go missing after merging from a split-brain scenario. [7697]
- There should be a User Code Deployment feature to perform distributed loading of classes so that jobs like MapReduce and Aggregate can be done more effectively. [7394]
- MapLoader misses state updates on second load on the receiver members. [7364]
- If the system retries an operation because a member is leaving the cluster, the invocation can be retried due to the response but also due to the "member-left" event. In most cases this should not lead to a problem, but the invocation may be executed twice. This can be a problem and can lead to a permanent inconsistent system. [7270]
- Using Lock and Map, the heap memory on Hazelcast server keeps increasing. All the created Locks and Maps are destroyed by the method `destroy()`, but the memory cannot be destroyed by the garbage collector even via FGC. When an application runs for some time, Hazelcast server goes down. [7246]
- Hazelcast 3.5 throws InvalidConfigurationException. [6523]
- More granular mutexes should be used when creating and removing a set of closeable cache resources. [6273]
- Running `PredicateBuilder` queries when nodes join causes timeouts and cluster crash. [6242]
- The configuration schemas Hazelcast Spring XSD and Hazelcast default configuration XSD are out of sync. They must have the same elements. [5034]
- The method setEvictionPolicy for near cache configuration wants a string argument whereas the same for map configuration wants an enum value. [2010]
- Fix inconsistent Ringbuffer TTL defaults: when starting a HazelcastInstance without an explicit configuration (`HazelcastInstance hz = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();`), the default Ringbuffer TTL was 30 seconds, instead of correct value 0. This change may break existing applications relying on the default configuration. [9610]

4. Known Issues

None.

5. Removed/Deprecated Features

- Aggregators feature is deprecated. Instead, Fast-Aggregations feature should be used.
