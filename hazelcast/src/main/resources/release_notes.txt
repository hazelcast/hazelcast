This document lists the new features, enhancements, fixed issues and, removed or deprecated features for Hazelcast IMDG 4.0.x releases. The numbers in the square brackets refer to the issues in Hazelcast's GitHub repositories.

==== 4.0.2 ====

1. Enhancements

* Introduced the `ConfigRecognition` API that determines
if a provided declarative configuration is recognized by the
rules defined in a given implementation. [#17093]
* Introduced WAN throttling mechanism: this allows
the WAN publishers to overload the WAN consumers if transferring the WAN
events takes less time than processing them in the target cluster. This
can be the case with WAN synchronization if the network latency is low
enough. It can be configured using the following properties:
  ** `hazelcast.wan.consumer.invocation.threshold`
  ** `hazelcast.wan.consumer.ack.delay.backoff.init`
  ** `hazelcast.wan.consumer.ack.delay.backoff.max`
  ** `hazelcast.wan.consumer.ack.delay.backoff.multiplier`

  See link:https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/4.0.2/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/spi/properties/ClusterProperty.java#L1112[here] for their explanations. [#17088]
* Removed a constraint which was rejecting all the operations
except the ones marked with `AllowedDuringPassiveState` while a
member is shutting down. With this enhancement, operations are allowed
and this provides additional safety guarantees especially for the members
holding large amounts of data. [#17029]
* Introduced a packet flag to distinguish between the connections of members
having the same Hazelcast version and different versions. [#16993]
* Updated `pom.xml` to have the latest version of the Hazelcast AWS plugin,
which introduced the support for AWS Fargate. [#16990]
* Added the `load()` method to `Config`, `ClientConfig` and
`ClientFailoverConfig` classes. This method loads the configuration
with the known locations. If not found, the default configuration is returned. [#16903]
* Added the missing partition/active partition count descriptor constants
to the metrics. [#16858]

2. Fixes

* Fixed an issue where the split-brain protection events were triggered during the
startup of members, but before they join the cluster. With this fix,
these listeners will not be fired until the minimum cluster size (quorum) is met after the
member startups. [#17090]
* Fixed an issue where the CP client message tasks were deserializing
the responses. [#17054]
* Fixed the broken interoperability between the `CompletableFuture`
methods. [#17048]
* Fixed an issue where the Hazelcast cluster having advanced network
configuration was not sending the proper connection information
to Management Center. [#17003]
* Fixed an issue in the cache service where its pre-join
operation was considering `CacheConfig` as resolved: it
was assuming that key/value types, user customizations and
other cache configurations have been loaded. This was an issue
when the cache is not touched yet. [#16918]
* Fixed an issue where the Hazelcast instances were failing to start
due to a missing flag for the cluster status. [#16852]
* Reverted the change where Hazelcast was not retrying an invocation if it is sent
to a specific member and returns the  `TargetNotMemberException` exception. [#16843]
* Fixed an issue where the class definitions, that are registered explicitly in
the serialization configuration and have the same class ID in different factories,
were not handled properly. [#16833]

==== 4.0.1 ====

1. Enhancements

* Introduced trusted interfaces concept for the Management Center
connections. It is now possible to restrict the source IP addresses
from which the Management Center operations are allowed.
See the Limiting Source Addresses section.
* Added the `creationTime` field to the `Executor` JMX bean. [#16774]
* Promoted the `IMap.putAllAsync()` and `IMap.submitToKeys()` methods to IMDG's public API. [#16771]
* Upgraded the Spring, Hibernate 5 and Session Clusterin (hazelcast-wm) dependency
versions for Hazelcast IMDG 4.x. [#16731]
* Updated the related aspects of Hazelcast IMDG after the changes done on the client protocol
side to add the ability to add new parameters, methods, services, events and custom types to codecs. [#16719]
* Upgraded Log4J2 version to 2.13.0. [#16658]
* Introduced the `hazelcast.logging.details.enabled` property to make the logging
of cluster version, name and IP optional to decrease the noise in the logs when, for
example, you have a single-member cluster. [#16630]
* Updated the link:https://hazelcast.org/hub/?project=kubernetes-cloud-discovery[Hazelcast Kubernetes^]
plugin to 2.0.1. [#16591]
* Added the support for automatically detecting the classloader of a type for the user
code deployment feature. [#16584]

2. Fixes

* Fixed an issue where the `Metrics` beans were missing the standard `Type`
information when monitoring with JMX. [#16729]
* Fixed an issue when a Raft leader stops receiving heartbeats from the majority
and it switches to the follower role in the same term: during this switch, it was also
deleting its own vote in the term. [#16645]
* Fixed an invalidation issue when using a transactional map
from a cache with a Near Cache: the cache invalidation event occurs when
the `transactionalMap.put` method is called. As a result, the entry was getting
invalidated before the change is committed to the map. [#16638]
* Fixed an issue where the wait key of a blocking call within a Raft
invocation was still being reported as a live operation, when the key times out. [#16615]
* Fixed an issue where the upload of classes using the client user
code deployment were not successful when they are retrieved not in their
created order.  [#16611]
* Fixed an issue where the `size()` method was returning a negative value
when map, cache and multimap contain more than `Integer.MAX_VALUE` entries. [#14935]
