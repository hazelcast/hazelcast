This document lists the new features, enhancements, fixed issues and, removed or deprecated features for Hazelcast IMDG 4.1.6 release. The numbers in the square brackets refer to the issues in Hazelcast's GitHub repositories.

## Enhancements

* Improved the log message that is displayed when using the `hazelcast.io.selectorMode`
property to decrease the high CPU usage. The previous misleading message read as
"Recreated Selector because of possible java/network stack bug". It has been changed
to "Selector was rebuilt, consider updating Java and/or your network stack drivers". [#19761]
* Introduced the `hazelcast.internal.map.expired.key.scan.timeout.nanos` property
to limit the execution time of the cleanup operations, i.e., entry expiration tasks of a map;
this is to prevent the increased CPU usage as the partition size grows. [#19663]

## Fixes

* Hazelcast was executing cluster wide operations when you query
the state of a member using the health check endpoint - it was causing to kill all the members
in a cluster; this issue has been fixed. [#19837]
* The increment command (`incr`) in the Memcache client
was returning the ASCII code of the expected result; this interpretation
issue has been fixed. [#19681]
