This document lists the new features, enhancements, fixed issues and, removed or deprecated features for Hazelcast 5.0-BETA-1 release. The numbers in the square brackets refer to the issues in Hazelcast's GitHub repositories.

Hazelcast 5.0 will be a major release which unifies the former Hazelcast IMDG and Jet products in a single solution. The changes are summarized below.

For information on upgrading from previous IMDG and Jet releases, see the "Migrate to this Version" chapter of Hazelcast documentation.

To learn about the changes in previous IMDG and Jet releases, see https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/rn/ and
https://jet-start.sh/blog/[Jet release notes].

## New Features

* **SQL Engine:** We have added the support of following operators to our SQL engine:
  ** INSERT
  ** UPDATE
  ** DELETE
  ** ORDER BY
  ** GROUP BY
  ** JOIN
  ** CASE
  [#18940], [#18910], [#18946], [#18569], [#18479], [#18483], [#18422], [#18067]
  
* **Compact Serialization Format (Preview Feature):** We have introduced a new serialization format
(`CompactSerializer`), which is in its beta stage currently. This format requires much
less storage space, provides better latency and throughput, and supports more extensive type sets:
  ** It supports schema evolution of a class and does not require any version to be specified explicitly.
  ** On common use cases where the field types of an object are natively supported via this compact format,
  Java DTO classes are automatically serialized without requiring a serializer (`CompactSerializer`) to be implemented.
  ** Your classes do not need to implement an interface like `Portable`. Once you enable the compact serialization,
  the classes not matching to any other serialization methods are serialized in this new format.
  [#19017]

* **Merkle Tree for ICache:** Like Hazelcast maps, now caches (`ICache`) also support
the Delta WAN Synchronization using Merkle trees. [#18898]

## Breaking Changes

### BETA API Changes

* Changed the type of `YEAR` field in the SQL client protocol from `short` to `int`. [#18984]
* Since the `HOST` and `RACK` metadata were deprecated in the previous Hazelcast
release, these information are removed from the `ZONE_AWARE` partition grouping
configuration. [#18780]
* Since DAG printing was not reflecting the real queue size, the `DAG.toDotString(int defaultParallelism)` method
signature is changed as `DAG.toDotString(int defaultLocalParallelism, int defaultQueueSize)`. You, now, need to supply the
queue size that will be shown if it is not overriden on the edge. [#18475]

### Configuration Changes

* Removed the following properties that were used in the former Jet product, since it
is now part of Hazelcast 5.0:
  ** `jet.home`
  ** `jet.imdg.version.mismatch.check.disabled`
  [#18999]
  
## Enhancements

### Distribution

* Hazelcast distribution is now available in two versions: full and slim.
While the full one includes Hazelcast and all of its modules along with SQL,
Jet engine extensions and Management Center, the slim one only includes the Hazelcast
runtime, default configurations and scripts.
for details. [#18990], [#18989]
* Consolidated the scripts delivered with the former IMDG and Jet distributions.
See the Changes in Distribution Packaging section. [#18999]
* The former `hazelcast-sql`, `hazelcast-sql-core` and `hazelcast-jet-sql` Maven modules in the distributions
have been merged into a single `hazelcast-sql` module as a part of the Hazelcast 5.0 distribution. [#18584]
* Removed the `jackson-core` dependency from `pom.xml` since it was
breaking the extensions that depend on `jackson`. [#18665]
* Moved the former Hazelcast Jet code samples into the Hazelcast code samples repository. [#475]

### The Jet and SQL Engine 

* The Jet engine jobs submitted in a Hazelcast cluster are now cancelled
when you upgrade your Hazelcast version since the Jet engine doesn't provide backwards compatibility. [#19012]
* Added support of the `putIfAbsentAsync()` method for maps on the member side;
which is required for the usage of `INSERT INTO` statements in SQL queries. [#18946]
* Added support of returning nested fields without having to
deserialize them, which enables you to use `Portable` in client/server
deployments without touching the server side; for example, SQL queries
can now return columns without having the class on the server-side classpath. [#18922]
* Standardized the `TIME` and `TIMESTAMP` temporal formats for the
SQL engine: You can now use `TIME` without leading zeroes and `TIMESTAMP`
with space instead of the `T` symbol. Also added support of leading non-zero
characters for the `DATE` formats. [#18881], [#18842]
* Added support of `OFFSET` for SQL queries. [#18866]
* Changed the `since` tags in Jet engine API and its extension modules
from  `@since x.y` to `@since Jet x.y`. [#18832]
* Implemented the `OnHeapMapScanP` class to read the Hazelcast maps directly
by the SQL engine. [#18685]
* Implemented a basic memory management for the SQL engine
so that number of records accumulated by it can be limited
to avoid out of memory failures. You can use the `max-processor-accumulated-records`
configuration element for this purpose. [#18671]
* Added support of dynamic parameters for the SQL engine and file table functions. [#18613], [#18522]
* Introduced `QueryDataType.MAP` and `QueryDataTypeFamily.MAP` to support map operand checks
for file table functions. [#18602]
* Added support of `EXTRACT(field FROM source)` for the SQL engine.
The function computes date parts from the source field. The supported types for `source` argument are as follow:
  ** Date
  ** Time
  ** Timestamp
  ** Timestamp With Time Zone
  [#18570]
* Added support of the `LIMIT <n>` clauses for the streaming engine. [#18479]
* Implemented the following functions for the SQL engine:
  ** `REPLACE`
  ** `ATAN2`
  ** `POWER`
  ** `SQUARE`
  ** `SQRT`
  ** `CBRT`
  ** `POSITION`
  ** `COALESCE`
  ** `NULLIF`
  ** `TO_EPOCH_MILLIS`
  ** `TO_TIMESTAMP_TZ`
  [#18900],[#18856], [#18510], [#18487], [#18450], [#18424], [#18405]
* Added support of plan caching for Jet engine based queries. [#18446]
* Added support of plus and minus operations for interval types (date, time, etc.) for
the SQL engine. [#18390]
* Added support of various new `Portable` types for the SQL engine. [#18115]
* Added support of `IN` and `BETWEEN` operators for the SQL queries. [#18483], [#18422], [#18067]

### Serialization

* Added support of default serializers for the following classes
which has been necessary for non-Java clients to use these:
  ** `LocalDate`
  ** `LocalTime`
  ** `LocalDateTime`
  ** `OffsetDatetime`
  [#18983]

### Security

* Introduced the simple authentication configuration; it allows to have users and
their assigned roles stored together with other Hazelcast configurations. See the example [#18948]:

hazelcast:
  security:
    enabled: true
    realms:
      - name: simpleRealm
        authentication:
          simple:
            users:
              - username: test
                password: 'a1234'
                roles:
                  - monitor
                  - hazelcast
              - username: root
                password: 'secret'
                roles:
                  - admin
  

### Configuration

* Added a configuration option to enable/disable resource uploading for
Jet engine jobs.
* Even when the factory configuration is missing on the member but
the map is configured to have the the in-memory format as `OBJECT`, Hazelcast now can store
portables as `PortableGenericRecord` and still query them
without needing to convert them to Object/Data. [#18891]
* Introduced the following properties:
  ** `hazelcast.partition.rebalance.mode`: It determines whether cluster
  membership change triggers partition rebalancing automatically (`auto`) or
  explicit action is required for rebalancing to occur (`manual`). Its default is `auto`.
  ** `hazelcast.partition.rebalance.delay.seconds`: it specifies the time in seconds
  to wait before triggering automatic partition
  rebalancing after a member leaves the cluster unexpectedly. Unexpectedly in this
  context means that a member leaves the cluster by programmatic termination, a
  process crash or network partition. Its default is 0, which means rebalancing is
  triggered immediately.
  [#18425]

### Other Enhancements

* Added the client console entry point to the Hazelcast command line
interface; you can now use the `hazelcast console` command to start
the client console application. [#18857]
* Enhanced the `getPartitionGroupStrategy()` method to have cluster members
as arguments so that useful partitioning strategies can be implemented by accessing
the members using this method. [#18794]
* The log message for infinite cluster connection timeout is clearer now.
Previously, it was represented as the value of `Long.MAX_VALUE`. [#18642]
* Introduced a new mechanism in the background expiration tasks;
now a thread local array controls the allocations for these tasks otherwise
which may cause increased garbage collection pressure and CPU usage spikes when
you use aggressive expiration configurations, e.g., low time-to-live values. [#18633]
* The license key is, now, not shown while starting a member on Docker with overriding configurations. [#18568]
* Limited the number of parallel partition reads (to a fixed value of five)
for maps and caches to prevent out of memory failures. [#18663], [#18499]
* Added a comprehensive documentation for metrics produced by Hazelcast.
See https://docs.hazelcast.com/imdg/5.0/list-of-hazelcast-metrics.html[here]
for the full list of metrics with their descriptions. [#17880]
* Improved the speed of connection by a member when it joins the cluster, by
removing the unnecessary `sleep` statements in the code. [#17428]

== Fixes

* SQL expressions now does not fail when used with trailing semicolons. [18976]
* Fixed an issue where the health monitor was incorrectly showing the value for
free metadata memory. [#18951]
* Some merge policies like `LatestUpdateMergePolicy` for the map and WAN replication
configurations require the per-entry statistics to be enabled. Previously, this
configuration inconsistency was causing the related member to fail at runtime.
Now, the Hazelcast member fails to start, i.e., fast fails, in such a case. [#18928]
* Fixed an issue where the maximum size policy for a map was being ignored
when the policy is `PER_NODE` and the cluster is scaled down (due to losing or killing a member). [#18927]
* The LRU eviction policy now takes last access time value into account to
prevent premature removal of the lately added but not yet accessed map entries. [#18909]
* Fixed an issue where the map’s Near Cache was setting its maximum
size as 10.000 even if the configured eviction policy is `NONE`. [#18835]
* Fixed a regression issue where a job using map reader/writer could not be completed
when the target map has a configured Near Cache. [#18696]
* Fixed an issue where the updates made to a persistent map store might be lost when the
write coalescing is enabled. [#18686]
* Fixed a reconnection flood when members are separated by a proxy: When a member is disconnected
from the cluster, the alive cluster members still try to reconnect to it if the dying member
connection is not closed explicitly. In the cases where the connection is explicitly closed with a cause
(such as `Connection reset by peer` or `Remote socket closed!`), a new connection was being established
if the member is placed behind a proxy. This scenario was end causing opening and closing connections continuously.
This issue has been fixed. [#18673]
* Fixed an issue where the multicast discovery was not working between the members
when the loopback mode is enabled. [#18669]
* The `HazelcastInstance.shutdown()` method now gracefully terminate Jet engine jobs, too.
After the merge of IMDG and Jet, it was failing. [#18625]
* Replicated Map does not fail to publish events anymore, from an entry listener with a predicate
which has an attribute path. [#18623]
* Fixed a possible performance regression by not starting the cooperative threads
until a job is submitted; otherwise the Jet engine was consuming system resources. [#18574]
* Fixed an issue where running SQL statements was fetching results incorrectly
(from an unexpected mapping) when there are different user-provided schemas for
data structures and mappings. [#18428]
* Fixed an issue where there might be continuous reconnection attempts by the
cluster members to a failed member, even its connection is explicitly closed
and when Hazelcast is placed behind a proxy. [#18320]
* Hazelcast now properly works on hosts with multiple NICs. [#17834]

== Removed/Deprecated Features

* Former `Jet`, `JetInstance` and `JetCacheManager` classes have been deprecated.
See xref:migrate:upgrade.adoc#depreciation-of-the-jet-and-jetinstance-classes[here]
for details. Accordingly `JetInstance` has been removed from Hazelcast's command line
interface (CLI) and Jet engine tests (also the name of CLI has been changed to `HazelcastCommandLine`). [#18829], [#18775], [#18667]
* Former Hazelcast Jet's `bootstrappedInstance()` has been deprecated. Instead, you can use `Hazelcast.bootstrappedInstance()`.
See xref:migrate:upgrade.adoc#depreciation-of-the-jet-and-jetinstance-classes[here] for details.
* The support of `NULLS FIRST` and `NULLS LAST` has been removed from the SQL engine;
the indices treat `NULL` as the smallest value in ordering, therefore we needed to disable temporarily these constructs. [#19031]
* The configuration element `hot-restart-persistence` has been deprecated.
You can use `persistence` instead, which is the successor of `hot-restart-persistence`.
If both are enabled, Hazelcast uses the `persistence` configuration.
The `hot-restart-persistence` element will be removed in a future release. [#19004]
* The `hazelcast-all` module has been removed from the Hazelcast distribution after the merge of
former IMDG and Jet products.
