# This is a sample Hazelcast configuration focused on hardened security.
# It lists configuration sections which could help with securing your installation.
#
# How to use it:
#   * rename `hazelcast.xml` in the `[HAZELCAST_INSTALL]/config` directory to `hazelcast.xml.bak`
#   * copy this file to the `[HAZELCAST_INSTALL]/config` directory with a new name `hazelcast.yaml`
#   * edit the copied `hazelcast.yaml` file:
#     - update IP addresses to match your environment;
#     - enable TLS, security and auditlog if you use the Hazelcast Enterprise;
#   * run Hazelcast with sensitive config values specified via a system property:
#
#     $ export JAVA_OPTS="-Dcustom.cluster.name=[YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME] -Duser.root.password=[SECRET_VALUE_HERE] -Duser.appuser.password=[ANOTHER_SECRET_HERE]"
#     $ HAZELCAST_CONFIG=config/hazelcast.yaml [HAZELCAST_INSTALL]/bin/hz-start
