# This is a full example hazelcast-client-failover.yaml that includes all
# the configuration nodes of a Hazelcast client Blue/Green Deployment and
# Disaster Recovery configuration.
#
# To use this, rename it to hazelcast-client-failover.yaml and place it in
# the directory where you start your Hazelcast client.
#
# To learn how to configure Hazelcast clients for Blue/Green Deployment and
# Disaster Recovery, please see the Reference Manual at

hazelcast-client-failover:
  # 
  # The Hazelcast client can configurations that the client is using to connect to a Hazelcast cluster in the case
  # of a disconnect is listed under the <clients> element. You can list client configurations as many as you want.
  # Each client configuration can be listed via <client> element nested into the <clients> element.
  #
  clients:
    - your-first-hazelcast-client-configuration.yaml
    - your-second-hazelcast-client-configuration.yaml
  #
  # Each time the client is disconnected from a cluster and it cannot connect back to the same one, the configured
  # client configuration defined under the "clients" element is iterated over. Count of these iterations before the
  # client decides to shut down is provided using the "try-count" configuration element. See the following
  # configuration related sections.
  # 
  try-count: 4
