        <!--
            The preferred port number where the Hazelcast instance will listen. The convention is
            to use 5701 and it is the default both here and in various tools connecting to
            Hazelcast. This configuration has the following attributes:
            - port-count:
                The default value is 100, meaning that Hazelcast will try to bind 100 ports.
                If you set the value of port as 5701, as members join the cluster, Hazelcast tries
                to find ports between 5701 and 5801. You can change the port count in cases like
                having large instances on a single machine or you are willing to have only a few
                ports assigned.
            - auto-increment:
                Default value is true. If port is set to 5701, Hazelcast will try to find free
                ports between 5701 and 5801. Normally, you will not need to change this value, but
                it comes in handy when needed. You may also want to choose to use only one port.
                In that case, you can disable the auto-increment feature of port by setting its
                value as false.

        <!-- Sets the maximum number of records that can be accumulated by any single
             Processor instance.
             Operations like grouping, sorting or joining require certain amount of
             records to be accumulated before they can proceed. You can set this option
             to reduce the probability of OutOfMemoryError.

             This option applies to each Processor instance separately, hence the
             effective limit of records accumulated by each cluster member is influenced
             by the vertex's localParallelism and the number of jobs in the cluster.

             Currently, maxProcessorAccumulatedRecords limits:
                - number of items sorted by the sort operation
                - number of distinct keys accumulated by aggregation operations
                - number of entries in the hash-join lookup tables
                - number of entries in stateful transforms
                - number of distinct items in distinct operation

             Note: the limit does not apply to streaming aggregations.
