/**
 * This is an endurance test that tests if the uring wrapper can correctly
 * handle overflow problems. The issue is that the C implementation of uring
 * uses a 32 bit unsigned 32 bits int and Java doesn't support that explicitly
 * because in Java all ints are signed.
 * <p/>
 * So this test will run concurrent nops on a uring instances and checks if
 * there are any problems and all the issues requests complete without errors.
 * <p/>
 * On a reasonably powerful machine (AMD 5950x) this test takes almost 3m to
 * complete with 10B operations and concurrency of 1000.
