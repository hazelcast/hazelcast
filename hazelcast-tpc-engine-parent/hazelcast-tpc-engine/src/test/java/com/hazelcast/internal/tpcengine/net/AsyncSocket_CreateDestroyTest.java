/**
 * A test that verifies that an AsyncSocket can be created and destroyed many
 * times after each other. The NioReactor should be fine since the resources
 * will be gc's by the JVM automatically, but it will help to flush out problems
 * in the UringReactor because of unsafe memory allocation, OS resources that need
 * to be released like the file descriptors etc.
 * <p>
 * There are short running tests for the regular tests, and there are also nightly
 * version that run much longer.
