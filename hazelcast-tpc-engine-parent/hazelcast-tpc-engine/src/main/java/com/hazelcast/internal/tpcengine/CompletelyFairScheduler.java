/**
 * A {@link Scheduler} that always schedules the task group with the lowest
 * vruntime first and is modelled after the Linux CFS scheduler.
 * <p/>
 * The CompletelyFairScheduler is a fair scheduler. So if there are 2 tasks
 * with equal weight, they will both get half of the CPU time. If one of the
 * tasks is blocked, the other task will get all the CPU time.
 * <p/>
 * Currently a min-heap is used to store the tasks based on the vruntime. On the
 * original CFS scheduler a red-black tree is used. The complexity of picking the
 * task with the lowest vruntime is O(1). The complexity for reinserting is
 * O(log(n)). The complexity of removing the task (when the tasks for example
 * blocks) is O(log(n)).
 * <p/>
 * The target latency is the total amount of latency proportionally divided
 * over the different TaskQueues. If there are e.g. 4 tasksQueues and the
 * target latency is 1ms, then each TaskQueue will get a time slice of 250us.
 * <p/>
 * To prevent running a task for a very short period of time, the min
 * granularity is used to set the lower bound of the time slice. So if there are
 * e.g 100 runnable task queues, then each task queue will get a timeslice of
 * 10us. But if the min granularity is 50us, then the time slice will be 50us.
