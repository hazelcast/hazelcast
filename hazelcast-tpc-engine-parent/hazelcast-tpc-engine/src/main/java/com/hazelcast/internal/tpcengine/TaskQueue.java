/**
 * A TaskQueue is the unit of scheduling within the eventloop. Each eventloop
 * has a default TaskQueue. But it is also possible to create additional
 * TaskQueues. For example when you have tasks for clients, but also long
 * running tasks from e.g. some compaction process, you could give the clients
 * and the compaction process their own taskQueues. If no clients are busy,
 * the compaction process can get all resources. But when clients need to CPU,
 * they can get it.
 * <p>
 * The TaskQueue can be configured with either either (or both):
 * <ol>
 *     <li>inside queue: for tasks submitted within the eventloop. This queue
 *     doesn't need to be thread safe.</li>
 *     <li>outside queue: for tasks submitted outside of the eventloop. This
 *     queue needs to be thread safe.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p/>
 * When there is only 1 queue, Tasks in the same TaskQueue will be processed in
 * FIFO order. When there are 2 queues, tasks will be picked in round robin
 * fashion and tasks in the same queue will be picked in FIFO order.
 * <p>
 * TaskGroups are relatively cheap. A task group that is blocked, will not be
 * on the run queue of the scheduler. But if the task group has a outside queue,
 * periodically a check will be done to see if there are tasks on the outside
 * queue.
 * <p>
 * Every TaskQueue has a vruntime which stands for virtual runtime. This is used
 * by the {@link CompletelyFairScheduler} to pick the TaskQueue with the lowest
 * vruntime.
 * <p>
 * vruntime/pruntime
 * This number could be distorted when there are other threads running on the
 * same CPU because If a different task would be executed while a task is running
 * on the CPU, the measured time will include the time of that task as well.
 * <p>
 * In Linux terms the TaskQueue would be the sched_entity.
 * <p>
 * The TaskQueue is inspired by the <a href="https://github.com/DataDog/glommio">Glommio</>
 * TaskQueue.
 * <p>
 * The TaskQueue isn't threadsafe and should only be used from the eventloop thread.
 * The only method which is threadsafe is the {@link #offerOutside(Object)} since
 * jobs can be offered outside of the eventloop.
