/**
 * The HazelcastClient is comparable to the {@link com.hazelcast.core.Hazelcast} class and provides the ability
 * the create and manage Hazelcast clients. Hazelcast clients are {@link HazelcastInstance} implementations, so
 * in most cases most of the code is unaware of talking to a cluster member or a client.
 * <p/>
 * <h1>Smart vs unisocket clients</h1>
 * Hazelcast Client enables you to do all Hazelcast operations without being a member of the cluster. Clients can be:
 * <ol>
 * <li>smart: this means that they immediately can send an operation like map.get(key) to the member that owns that
 * specific key.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * unisocket: it will connect to a random member in the cluster and send requests to this member. This member then needs
 * to send the request to the correct member.
 * </li>
 * </ol>
 * For more information see {@link com.hazelcast.client.config.ClientNetworkConfig#setSmartRouting(boolean)}.
 * <p/>
 * <h1>High availability</h1>
 * When the connected cluster member dies, client will automatically switch to another live member.
