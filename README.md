## Hazelcast is a clustering and highly scalable data distribution platform for Java.

With its various distributed data structures, distributed caching capabilities, elastic nature, memcache support,
integration with Spring and Hibernate and more importantly with so many happy users, Hazelcast is feature-rich,
enterprise-ready and developer-friendly in-memory data grid solution.

### Features:

* Distributed implementations of `java.util.{Queue, Set, List, Map}`
* Distributed implementation of `java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock`
* Distributed implementation of `java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService`
* Distributed `MultiMap` for one-to-many relationships
* Distributed `Topic` for publish/subscribe messaging
* Synchronous (write-through) and asynchronous (write-behind) persistence
* Transaction support
* Socket level encryption support for secure clusters
* Second level cache provider for Hibernate
* Monitoring and management of the cluster via JMX
* Dynamic HTTP session clustering
* Support for cluster info and membership events
* Dynamic discovery, scaling, partitioning with backups and fail-over

### Building From Source

Pull latest from repo `git pull origin master` and use Maven install (or package) to build `mvn clean install`.

### Testing

Hazelcast has 3 testing profiles:

* **Default**: Type `mvn test` to run quick/integration tests (those can be run in-parallel without using network).
* **Slow Tests**: Type `mvn test -P slow-test` to run tests those are either slow or cannot be run in-parallel.
* **All Tests**: Type `mvn test -P all-tests` to run all test serially using network.
