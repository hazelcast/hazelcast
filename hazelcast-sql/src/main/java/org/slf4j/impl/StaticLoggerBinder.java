/**
 * Apache Calcite has a dependency on the {@code slf4j-api} artifact. In order to JAR hell in the runtime, we shade and
 * relocate the {@code slf4j-api} library into the {@code com.hazelcast} package during build.
 * <p>
 * SLF4J requires exactly one {@code StaticLoggerBinder} class to be in the JVM classpath. Otherwise a warning is printed
 * into the {@code System.err} unconditionally. See {@code LoggerFactory.bind} for more details.
 * <p>
 * This class helps us get rid of the warning. During relocation both this class and {@code LoggerFactory} are moved to the
 * the {@code com.hazelcast} package. As a result the relocated factory finds the relocated binder and no warning is produced.
 * <p>
 * At the same time, the normal SLF4J dependency still looks for the binder at the usual location, and therefore other runtime
 * classes that use SLF4J are not affected. That is, the current binder affects only the relocated Apache Calcite classes.
 * <p>
 * The binder delegates to the no-op logger factory, suppressing all messages from the relocated Apache Calcite.
