Changes
- added external name to SqlConnector#resolveAndValidateFields to be able to read the table metadata
- exposed fields in Comparison predicate to convert the predicate to SQL where part

TODO
- publish compact generic record instead of row ? is this possible?
- different parallelism if possible - for sink - insert, update and delete

- Refactor processor serialization (e.g. build query in processor constructor, serialize less fields)
- create PR with description
