TODO
- Refactor processor serialization (e.g. build query in processor constructor, serialize less fields)
- use external data store ref
- database schemas?
- parametrize connector type (default JDBC)
- different parallelism if possible - for sink - insert, update and delete

-  some conversion needed in SelectProcessorSupplier? maybe for dates (the opposite of convertValue)
