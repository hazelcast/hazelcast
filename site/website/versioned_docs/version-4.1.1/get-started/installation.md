In this step we'll show you how to create a Jet cluster.
Before involving remote machines we can take the initial step of running
a cluster on your local machine. This will already be very close to the
real thing because all the communication happens over network interfaces
and the nodes just happen to reside on the same physical machine.

There are two main approaches to setting up a local Hazelcast Jet
cluster: as a classic Java process or as a Docker instance. In order to
follow the tutorial, in both cases you'll need the Hazelcast Jet
distribution package. Download it from
[here](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/releases/download/v4.1.1/hazelcast-jet-4.1.1.tar.gz)
and unzip it to a directory we'll refer to as `<jet_home>`.

## As a Java Process

The distribution package contains everything you need to run Jet except
the JDK. Type this:

```bash
cd <jet_home>
bin/jet-start
```

This will start a Jet node in the foreground so you have to keep the
terminal window open and start another one to interact with it. It is
convenient because you can easily terminate Jet with Ctrl-C or closing
the window. In a production setting you can use the `-d` option to start
it in daemon mode.

The main entry point to interacting with the Jet cluster is the `jet`
command. For example, let's check the cluster state:

```bash
$ bin/jet cluster
State: ACTIVE
Version: 4.1.1
Size: 1

ADDRESS                  UUID
[192.168.0.2]:5701       27a73154-f4bb-477a-aef2-27ffa6f03a2d
```

The distribution package also contains a pre-packaged Jet job in a JAR
that you can use to quickly verify the installation. You can submit it
like this:

```bash
bin/jet submit examples/hello-world.jar
```

You should see output like this:

```text
Top 10 random numbers in the latest window:
    1. 9,148,584,845,265,430,884
    2. 9,062,844,734,542,410,944
    3. 8,803,176,683,229,613,741
    4. 8,779,035,965,085,775,340
    5. 8,542,080,641,730,428,499
    6. 8,528,134,348,376,217,974
    7. 8,290,200,710,152,066,026
    8. 8,008,893,323,519,996,615
    9. 7,804,055,086,912,769,625
    10. 7,681,774,251,691,230,162
```

## As a Docker Image

Hazelcast maintains an official Docker image for Hazelcast Jet. To start
a node, write this:

```bash
docker run hazelcast/hazelcast-jet
```

This should start a Hazelcast Jet node in a Docker container. Inspect
the log output for a line like this:

```text
Members {size:1, ver:1} [
    Member [172.17.0.2]:5701 - 4bc3691d-2575-452d-b9d9-335f177f6aff this
]
```

Note the IP address of the Docker container and use it in the commands
below instead of our example's `172.17.0.2`. Let's submit the Hello
World application from the distribution package, but this time using
Docker:

```bash
cd <jet_home>
docker run -it -v "$(pwd)"/examples:/examples hazelcast/hazelcast-jet jet -a 172.17.0.2 submit /examples/hello-world.jar
```

The command mounts the local `examples` directory from `<jet_home>` to
the container and uses `jet submit` to submit the example JAR. While the
job is running, it should produce output like this:

```text
Top 10 random numbers in the latest window:
    1. 9,148,584,845,265,430,884
    2. 9,062,844,734,542,410,944
    3. 8,803,176,683,229,613,741
    4. 8,779,035,965,085,775,340
    5. 8,542,080,641,730,428,499
    6. 8,528,134,348,376,217,974
    7. 8,290,200,710,152,066,026
    8. 8,008,893,323,519,996,615
    9. 7,804,055,086,912,769,625
    10. 7,681,774,251,691,230,162
```
