*Target Release*: 4.1

## Goal

Provide a convenient way to call gRPC services with good performance
as part of a pipeline.

## Background

A Jet pipeline can contact outside services to process the data. The
general facility is called `mapUsingService`, with variants that do
filtering and flat-mapping. With this transform, each processor creates
a proxy to a service and then invokes it for each input item. Jet also
supports services with async APIs through `mapUsingServiceAsync` and in
that case it can make several concurrent requests to the same service
without any blocking.

[gRPC](https://grpc.io) is an RPC framework for building network
services and handles concerns like transport, authentication and stub
generation with support for several different programming languages.

If you have a pipeline where you want to call a gRPC service for each
input item, you can use the `mapUsingService` transform directly, but
this will not give you the best performance because it will not be
making use of asynchronous calls and each processor will only have a
single request in flight a time. It's also possible to use
`mapUsingServiceAsync` in combination with the non-blocking stub, but
this requires a lot of boilerplate.

Furthermore, our internal tests showed that the most efficient gRPC
communication pattern is [bidirectional
streaming](https://grpc.io/docs/guides/concepts/#bidirectional-streaming-rpc).
Using it is even less straightforward, requiring some fairly advanced
code in the `ServiceFactory`.

As a part of the Jet-Python integration, we discovered some best
practices for integrating a Jet pipeline with gRPC, and the goal is to
apply these in a more generic way.

## Design

The implementation includes a new module `hazelcast-jet-grpc` which
is added to the `extensions` folder. The module has one main entry
point which is `GrpcServices` which provides the convenience for
creating `ServiceFactory` for the corresponding the gRPC service.

There are two methods added, where one is for unary service and the
other for the bidirectional service.

### Unary Service

Unary service is the most basic gRPC service type, where each request
has a matching response and the service is called in a request-response
fashion.

Given the protobuf definition below for a unary service:

```proto
service Greeter {
   // Sends a greeting
   rpc SayHello (HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply) {}
}
```

We can create the following service factory:

```java

ServiceFactory<?, ? extends GrpcService<HelloRequest, HelloResponse> greeterService = unaryService(
  () -> ManagedChannelBuilder.forAddress("localhost", 5000).usePlaintext(),
  channel -> GreeterGrpc.newStub(channel)::sayHello
);
```

where `GreeterGrpc` is the class auto-generated by the protobuf
compiler.

GrpcService has a very simple interface which only has a single method:

```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface GrpcService<T, R> {

    /**
     * Calls the requested service and returns a future which will be
     * completed with the result once a response is received.
     */
    @Nonnull
    CompletableFuture<R> call(@Nonnull T input);
}
```

So for every input item, a future containing the output item is created.

The created `ServiceFactory<.., GrpcService>` then can be used with the
`mapUsingServiceAsync` transform as follows:

```java
Pipeline p = Pipeline.create();
p.readFrom(TestSources.items("one", "two", "three", "four"))
  .mapUsingServiceAsync(greeterService, (service, input) -> {
    HelloRequest request = HelloRequest.newBuilder().setName(input).build();
    return service.call(request);
 })
 .writeTo(Sinks.logger());
```

In this implementation, Jet will simply send an async request for each
item, and when the matching response comes it will be emitted further
in the pipeline.

#### Ordering

When a unary service is used, the order of items and their matching
timestamps in a stream are always preserved. The `mapUsingServiceAsync`
transforms has several mechanisms for making sure that input/output
items are matched and they are emitted in the input order.

### Bidirectional Streaming

In bidirectional streaming mode, the requests are sent in a stream and
the replies are also sent as a stream. This can provide better
throughput because there's less overhead per item and there's also
opportunity to send requests in batches.

Given the proto definition below:

```proto
service Greeter {
  // Sends a greeting
  rpc SayHello (stream HelloRequest) returns (stream HelloReply) {}
}
```

We can create the following service factory:

```java
ServiceFactory<?, ? extends GrpcService<HelloRequest, HelloResponse> greeterService = bidirectionalStreamingService(
  () -> ManagedChannelBuilder.forAddress("localhost", 5000).usePlaintext(),
  channel -> GreeterGrpc.newStub(channel)::sayHello
);
```

The way the service is invoked in a `mapUsingServiceAsync` call would
be identical.

```java
Pipeline p = Pipeline.create();
p.readFrom(TestSources.items("one", "two", "three", "four"))
  .mapUsingServiceAsync(greeterService, (service, input) -> {
    HelloRequest request = HelloRequest.newBuilder().setName(input).build();
    return service.call(request);
 })
 .writeTo(Sinks.logger());
```

#### Ordering

In the bidirectional streaming style, gRPC doesn't enforce any
correlation between the input and output streams. However, from a
higher-level perspective, the service is just mapping the input to the
output, one item at a time, and Jet must match them up based on nothing
more than their order of appearance. Therefore, **for each input item
your gRPC service receives, it must emit exactly one output item in
exactly the same order.** If you want to filter out some items, you must
do that by using special "null sentinel" items that you can then filter
out in post-processing.

### Error Handling

If the gRPC service returns an error response, Jet completes the
corresponding future with an exception. For non-fatal errors you should
use `CompletableFuture.handle()` to map the exception to an appropriate
item, otherwise the job will fail.

## Future Work

It may be interesting to use a builder pattern for building the gRPC
factory to make the syntax a little simpler. This was investigated but
dropped for now due to increased complexity.

It may be possible to support unordered bidirectional streaming by
requiring a correlation id field to the requests and then matching them
to the responses, but this was also considered out of scope for now.

Currently the deployment and scaling of a gRPC service is left to user,
however it may be an option in the future to have a "Jet-managed" gRPC
bundle which contains the service, and that can be deployed alongside
the Jet nodes.
