The IMap connector supports reading and writing to local IMaps. Remote
IMaps are not supported yet.

Jet SQL works with IMaps through the concept of external mapping, just
like all other resources. It provides an additional convenience: if your
IMap already stores some data, Jet can automatically detect the key and
value types by sampling an existing entry. This works only when there's
at least one entry stored in every cluster node because we sample one
random node.

From the SQL semantics perspective, there is an implicit mapping for all
the local IMaps in the `partitioned` schema. To query a local IMap, you
can directly execute a statement against it. If you don't name a schema,
Jet first looks up the object in the `public` schema (where the
explicitly created mappings are created) and then in the `partitioned`
schema.

## Serialization Options

The `keyFormat` and `valueFormat` options are mandatory. Currently, if
you create the mapping explicitly, we can't resolve these from a sample.

Possible values for `keyFormat` and `valueFormat`:

* any of the supported [SQL data
  types](https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/4.1.1/manual/html-single/index.html#data-types),
  except for `OBJECT`
* `portable`
* `json`
* `java`

The key and value formats can be different.

### Primitive serialization

If the format is one of the primitive type names, then the Java class
representing that type will be stored in the IMap. By _primitive type_
we mean any [supported SQL data
type](https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/4.1.1/manual/html-single/index.html#data-types),
except for `OBJECT`.

For example, to create a mapping for `IMap<Integer, String>`, use:

```sql
CREATE MAPPING my_map
TYPE IMap
OPTIONS (
    'keyFormat'='int',
    'valueFormat'='varchar'
)
```

### `Portable` Serialization

For this format, you need to specify additional options:

* `keyPortableFactoryId`, `valuePortableFactoryId`
* `keyPortableClassId`, `valuePortableClassId`
* `keyPortableVersion`, `valuePortableVersion`: optional, default is `0`

Jet resolves the column list by looking at the `ClassDefinition` found
using the given factory ID, class ID, and version.

The benefit of this format is that it doesn't deserialize the whole key
or value when reading only a subset of fields. Also it doesn't require a
custom Java class to be defined on the cluster, so it's usable for
non-Java clients.

Example mapping where both key and value are `Portable`:

```sql
CREATE MAPPING my_map
TYPE IMap
OPTIONS (
    'keyFormat' = 'portable',
    'keyPortableFactoryId' = '123',
    'keyPortableClassId' = '456',
    'keyPortableVersion' = '0',  -- optional
    'valueFormat' = 'portable',
    'valuePortableFactoryId' = '123',
    'valuePortableClassId' = '789',
    'valuePortableVersion' = '0'  -- optional
)
```

For more information on `Portable` see Hazelcast IMDG Reference Manual.

### JSON Serialization

The value will be stored as `HazelcastJsonValue`. Jet can't
automatically determine the column list for this format, you must
explicitly specify it:

```sql
CREATE MAPPING my_map(
    __key BIGINT,
    ticker VARCHAR,
    amount INT)
TYPE IMap
OPTIONS (
    'keyFormat' = 'bigint',
    'valueFormat' = 'json')
```

There are no additional options for this format.

JSON's type system doesn't match SQL's exactly. For example, JSON
numbers have unlimited precision, but such numbers are typically not
portable. We convert SQL integer and floating-point types into JSON
numbers. We convert the `DECIMAL` type, as well as all temporal types,
to JSON strings.

We don't support the `JSON` type from the SQL standard yet. That means
you can't use functions like `JSON_VALUE` or `JSON_QUERY`. If your JSON
documents don't all have the same fields or if they contain nested
objects, the usability is limited.

Internally, we store all JSON values in the string form.

### Java Serialization

Java serialization is the last-resort serialization option. It uses the
Java object exactly as `IMap.get()` returns it. You can use it for
objects serialized using the Java serialization or Hazelcast custom
serialization (`DataSerializable` or `IdentifiedDataSerializable`).

For this format you must specify the class name using `keyJavaClass` and
`valueJavaClass` options, for example:

```sql
CREATE MAPPING my_map
TYPE IMap
OPTIONS (
    'keyFormat' = 'java',
    'keyJavaClass' = 'java.lang.Long',
    'valueFormat' = 'java',
    'valueJavaClass' = 'com.example.Person')
```

If the Java class corresponds to one of the basic data types (numbers,
dates, strings), that type will directly be used for the key or value
and mapped as a column named `__key` for keys and `this` for values. In
the example above, the key will be mapped with the `BIGINT` type. In
fact, the above `keyFormat` & `keyJavaClass` duo is equivalent to
`'keyFormat'='bigint'`.

If the Java class is not one of the basic types, Hazelcast will analyze
the class using reflection and use its properties as column names. It
recognizes public fields and JavaBean-style getters. If some property
has a non-primitive type, it will be mapped under the `OBJECT` type.

The class must be available to the cluster. You can either add it to the
members class paths by creating a JAR file and adding it to the `lib`
folder, or you can use User Code Deployment. The user code deployment
has to be enabled on the members; add the following section to the
`config/hazelcast.yaml` file:

```yaml
hazelcast:
  user-code-deployment:
    enabled: true
```

Then use a client to upload the class:

```java
ClientConfig clientConfig = new JetClientConfig();
clientConfig.getUserCodeDeploymentConfig()
            .setEnabled(true)
            .addClass(Trade.class);
JetInstance jet = Jet.newJetClient(clientConfig);
```

## External Column Name

You rarely need to specify the columns in DDL. If you do, you might need
to specify the external name for the column.

The entries in a map naturally have _key_ and _value_ elements. Because
of this, the format of the external name must be either `__key.<name>`
for a field in the key or `this.<name>` for a field in the value. If
it's just `<name>`, then `this.<name>` is assumed.

The external name defaults to `this.<columnName>`, so normally you only
need to specify it for key fields. There are also columns that represent
the entire key and value objects, called `__key` and `this`.

## Implicit Mapping for Existing IMaps

For existing IMaps with data you don't have to create a mapping at all,
you can directly query them. The mapping will be resolved based on a
random sample read from the map. However, it's not enough if the map has
only one entry - we search for a sample on a single random member; if a
sample entry isn't found, the query fails. Therefore if your IMap
doesn't contain many rows, it's safer to create a mapping explicitly.

The implicit mapping is also problematic if your map contains
heterogeneous data, for example instances of multiple classes or JSON
objects with varying set of keys. The mapping will be created from a
random sample and a different sample could be used each time leading to
a different column list each time.

## Heterogeneous Maps

For example, let's say you have this in a JSON-valued IMap:

|key|value|
|-|-|
|1|`{"name":"Alice","age":42}`|
|2|`{"name":"Bob","age":43,"petName":"Zaz"}`|

If you map the column `petName`, it will have the value `null` for the
entry with `key=1`. This scenario is supported.

Individual entries in the IMap may even use different serialization
strategies. We'll try to extract the field by name regardless of the
actual serialization format encountered at runtime. However, while this
works in the current release, this setup is unsupported - future
optimizations we plan to implement might break it. Only maps with
homogenous entries should be accessed through SQL.

## Remote IMap

IMaps in remote Hazelcast clusters are not yet supported.
