This section contains documents detailing technical design of Jet
features, created during the development process. Design docs for
features appears under that version's docs. Features developed for the
upcoming version appears under the [pre-release version
docs](/docs/next/design-docs).

Each document is numbered, though since we're just starting this process
we'll only include features for Jet starting from Jet 4.1. We've also
included some 4.1 features as part of 4.0 design docs for the new
website launch to give a preview of what's coming in 4.1. For a full
list of upcoming 4.1 features see the [pre-release version
docs](/docs/next/design-docs).
