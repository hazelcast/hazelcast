             Lossless Restart, Jet persists job snapshots to disk automatically
             and you can restart the whole cluster without losing the jobs and
             their state.

             This feature requires Jet Enterprise and is implemented on top of the
             Hot Restart feature of Hazelcast IMDG. Therefore you should configure
             Hot Restart in the hazelcast IMDG configuration, especially the base
             directory where to store the recovery files. If you don't, Jet will
             force-enable Hot Restart and apply some reasonable defaults.
